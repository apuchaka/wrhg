> [!info] Localisation status (Aug 2026): this primer has been through a full ANZCA-focused localisation pass — see the specific "Verified" notes below for what was checked and changed. The frontmatter `block:` field was also corrected here (was incorrectly tagged "Gastrointestinal" in the source file — this is its own Anaesthetics/Perioperative Care category per the CSV).

## General Anaesthesia

**D:** inducing loss of consciousness in a controlled environment, to prevent response to noxious stimuli. Triad of analgesia, amnesia/hypnosis, and muscle relaxation or paralysis.

### Pre-op checks
- Talking to the patient — PMH, medications/allergies, discussing concerns, consenting to GA
- Ask about previous anaesthetic use or family history of anaesthesia issues
- Risks to discuss: dental damage, sore throat, post-op nausea/vomiting, risk of MI and stroke

> [!info] Functional status — ASA grade
> 1 — Normally fit and well | 2 — Mild systemic disease, controlled | 3 — Severe systemic disease | 4 — Incapacitating disease, threat to life | 5 — Moribund (won't survive >24h even with operation) | 6 — Brain dead (organ donation)

> [!tip] Airway assessment — mnemonic "LEMON"
> **L**ook externally (abnormal neck, large tongue, dental issues); **E**valuate 3-3-2 (3 fingers between teeth, 2 between hyoid and mentum, 2 between hyoid and thyroid); **M**allampati score; **O**bstruction/obesity; **N**eck mobility (reduced in trauma, elderly)

### Induction of GA

**Inhalation** (e.g. sevoflurane, isoflurane) — associated with malignant hyperthermia

> [!danger] Gap-filled — malignant hyperthermia (MH) was only ever named as a bare association, and the Pre-Operative Assessment note elsewhere in this file incorrectly pointed here for "fuller detail" that didn't actually exist — genuinely misleading given MH is a life-threatening emergency, not a minor footnote. **D:** a rare, life-threatening hypermetabolic reaction triggered by volatile inhalational anaesthetics (e.g. sevoflurane, isoflurane) and/or the depolarising muscle relaxant suxamethonium. **A/P:** an autosomal dominant condition (most commonly a *RYR1* ryanodine receptor mutation) causing uncontrolled calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscle on exposure to a triggering agent — this drives sustained muscle contraction, massively increased metabolic rate, and runaway heat and CO2 production. **S/Smx:** the earliest and most sensitive sign is typically a rapid, otherwise-unexplained **rise in end-tidal CO2** despite adequate ventilation (reflecting the massive CO2 production, and often the first clue before temperature change is even apparent) — followed by masseter muscle rigidity, tachycardia, hyperthermia (a late sign, given the name; core temperature can rise very rapidly once established), and progressive hyperkalaemia, metabolic/respiratory acidosis, and myoglobinuria from ongoing muscle breakdown. **Mx:** stop the triggering agent immediately; **dantrolene IV** (a skeletal muscle relaxant that directly blocks the ryanodine receptor, halting the calcium release driving the reaction) is the specific, life-saving treatment — alongside active cooling, 100% oxygen, and correction of the resulting hyperkalaemia/acidosis. **Genuinely important for the pre-op assessment this is cross-referenced from**: a family history of anaesthetic complications should specifically prompt consideration of MH susceptibility testing (muscle biopsy contracture testing, or genetic testing where available) before an elective procedure, given this is a heritable condition where identifying at-risk family members prospectively is far safer than discovering susceptibility intraoperatively.

**Intravenous:**
- Propofol — fast-acting, good recovery characteristics; can cause hypotension
- Thiopental — not used much nowadays
- Ketamine — usually in paediatrics; can cause hypertension

**Paralytic agents:** used in operations where surgeons want to avoid abdominal pressure changes from diaphragm movement (e.g. laparoscopic procedures, major abdominal surgery). Agents include suxamethonium and rocuronium. Requires intubation and ventilation until the patient regains ability to maintain their own airway.

### Pre-op instructions

> [!info] Verified against ANZCA guidance (PG07 Fasting Guideline 2024; ANZCA Library perioperative anticoagulant/antiplatelet resources citing the 2022 CHEST guideline update), Aug 2026 — Australian practice differs from the UK figures this entry previously carried in several specifics, most importantly around anticoagulant bridging and fasting duration for clear fluids.
> **Medications to stop (unless otherwise directed by surgeon/anaesthetist):**
> - **DOACs:** current evidence-based practice is a short, bleeding-risk-stratified interruption — roughly 24h before surgery for low-bleeding-risk procedures, 48h for high-bleeding-risk procedures (longer, e.g. up to 72h, before neuraxial anaesthesia specifically) — **not** routine bridging with enoxaparin. DOAC bridging is now considered outdated for most patients; bridging is reserved for specific high-thromboembolic-risk warfarin patients (see below), not applied by default to DOACs the way the source note implies. Always seek clear instruction from the treating surgeon/anaesthetist for the specific patient.
> - **Warfarin:** stopped 3–5 days before surgery; bridging with LMWH considered only for patients at genuinely high thromboembolic risk (e.g. mechanical mitral valve, recent VTE, certain thrombophilias) — not a routine default for every anticoagulated patient.
> - **Antiplatelets:** aspirin — current guidance (2022 CHEST update, widely adopted in Australian practice) increasingly favours **continuing** aspirin through elective non-cardiac surgery rather than stopping it by default, given the low bleeding-risk increment versus the thrombotic risk of stopping — a shift from older blanket-cessation advice. Clopidogrel/other P2Y12 inhibitors — still generally held ~5–7 days before surgery. Dual antiplatelet therapy post-stent: as in the source note, delaying elective surgery is preferred where possible (1 year after drug-eluting stents, 30 days after bare-metal stents), with cardiology input if surgery cannot wait.
> - NSAIDs: stop — no AU-specific change to this general principle.
> - Insulin: continue basal insulin, but skip oral hypoglycaemics and fast-acting insulin when nil by mouth (NBM) — consistent with Australian Diabetes Society/ANZCA perioperative diabetes guidance; no material change.
> - **Combined oral contraceptive pill & HRT:** evolving evidence base — the traditional "stop 4 weeks before major surgery" advice is increasingly questioned, with more recent evidence describing the VTE-risk link as equivocal for many procedure types, and practice trending toward continuing through minor/intermediate-risk procedures and reserving cessation for major/high-VTE-risk surgery specifically (with transdermal HRT preparations generally considered lower-risk than oral). Given genuine ongoing debate, check the current local/institutional and treating-surgeon position directly rather than applying the flat 4-week rule by default.
> - **Fasting:** ANZCA's current position (PG07 Fasting Guideline 2024) is actually similar to standard UK teaching, so no correction was needed here: solid food/non-clear fluids stopped 6h before surgery, clear fluids permitted up to ~1–2h before (the liberal "Sip Til Send" approach — up to one small 200mL cup of clear fluid per hour while waiting — is increasingly favoured in current Australian practice over older, more restrictive fasting windows).

### Maintenance of GA

**Maintenance of unconsciousness:** inhalation (e.g. sevoflurane) or intravenous (e.g. propofol)

**Maintenance of analgesia:** important to remember the patient can be unconscious but still experience pain — may be reflected in ↑HR, ↑BP. Opioids (e.g. remifentanil, alfentanil), local anaesthetics.

### Stopping/reversing GA
- Usually involves stopping the induction/maintenance agent while maintaining the analgesic component
- Neostigmine can be given to reverse residual muscle paralysis and reduce anticholinergic side effects (e.g. salivation) as the patient wakes
- More predictable in total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) than with inhaled agents
- Variable time for patients to wake up; should only be extubated when they can obey commands and demonstrate muscle tone (e.g. "squeeze my hand")

---

## Airway Adjuncts

> [!note] Most airway adjuncts help open the airway to promote air delivery, but only endotracheal intubation and tracheostomies properly protect the airway.

### Oropharyngeal / Guedel airway (OPA)
- Measure by placing the tube on the patient's cheek — wide part near the front teeth, smaller opening at the angle of the jaw ("hard to hard")
- In adults, insert upside down, then twist 180° when reaching the back of the throat
- Poorly tolerated in conscious/semi-conscious patients (can cause gag reflex)

### Nasopharyngeal airway (NPA)
- Tube passed through the nostril to the back of the throat; bypasses obstructions in the mouth/base of tongue
- Measure with one end at the tip of the nose, other end at the tragus of the ear ("soft to soft")
- Insert as if inserting an NG tube — aim straight, not downwards

> [!danger] Contraindicated if suspected skull base fracture (risk of intracranial passage).

### Supraglottic airway
Divided into laryngeal mask airway (LMA) and iGel.
- The end sits at the vocal cords, forming a seal to block the oesophageal opening (lowers aspiration risk)
- Does not enter the trachea completely, so still carries some aspiration risk — cannot be said to fully protect the airway
- Useful for short or low-risk procedures (e.g. incision and drainage of simple abscesses)

**Laryngeal mask airway:** reusable supraglottic device; some versions have inflatable seals (better seal) and gastric ports for drainage/suction of secretions.

**iGel:** single-use supraglottic device; seal activated by body temperature (no inflation required).

### Bag-valve-mask (BVM)
- Mask placed over nose and mouth (usually with head tilt-chin lift manoeuvre + tight seal)
- Compression of the bag → increased pressure → opens valve → air passes into the mask
- Can be connected to oxygen ± gas supply for pre-oxygenation
- Allows manual ventilation just before intubation

### Endotracheal tube
- Inserted with the help of a laryngoscope or fibreoptic camera into the trachea
- Usually size 7 for women, size 8 for men — may need resizing based on weight
- Depth needs to be marked (usually 20–24cm at the teeth), then taped to secure
- Inflatable cuff seals the trachea and prevents aspiration

### Laryngoscope
- Consists of "blades" and a torchlight
- Used to lift soft tissues and the epiglottis, directly visualising the larynx so the tube can be inserted past the vocal folds
- Patient needs to be able to bend their neck backwards for insertion

### Tracheostomies
Bypass the upper airway, directing ventilation through the trachea into the lungs.
- **Cricothyroidotomy:** done in emergencies — incision through the membrane between cricoid and thyroid cartilage, tube inserted through the incision
- **Surgical tracheostomy:** incision made through the trachea itself, tracheostomy inserted through this incision

### Added from unverified layer — tracheostomy and laryngectomy EMERGENCIES
`SRC:A2_Airway_Compromise__Stridor_and_Tracheostomy_Emergencies §0.4` `UNVERIFIED — model knowledge, not source-checked. Obtain and follow the current National Tracheostomy Safety Project (NTSP) emergency algorithms; the sequence below is orientation, not a substitute for them.` `NO-BASELINE — absent from the corpus before this merge; no inherited layer disagrees with it.`

> [!danger] **The first question is not "what is wrong with the tube" — it is "is there a patent upper airway?"**
> This single question splits the management completely, and it is answered from the notes and the bed-head sign, not from looking at the neck.
> - **TRACHEOSTOMY** — the larynx is intact and the upper airway is **patent**. The patient **can** be oxygenated via the face and **can** usually be intubated orally. You have two routes.
> - **LARYNGECTOMY** — the upper airway **ends blindly**. There is **no connection between mouth and trachea.** Face-mask oxygen and oral intubation are **useless**; everything must go via the stoma. **Getting this wrong wastes the only minutes available.**
>
> **Orientation to the emergency sequence:** call for help early including anaesthetics and ENT · **apply oxygen to BOTH the face and the stoma** until you know which is which · look, listen and feel at the stoma · **remove the inner cannula** — a blocked inner cannula is the commonest and most easily fixed cause · pass a suction catheter · if it will not pass, the tube is displaced or obstructed and comes out.

> [!danger] A displaced tube in a **fresh** tracheostomy — do not push a new one blindly
> A stoma **less than about a week old** has an **immature tract** that has not formed a stable channel. **Blind reinsertion creates a false passage into the pretracheal tissues**, which ventilates the neck rather than the lungs and is rapidly fatal. In a fresh stoma, **oxygenate from above** (the upper airway is patent in a tracheostomy) and get the airway to a person who can reinsert under vision.

> [!warning] Bleeding from a tracheostomy — the one that is not minor
> Minor bleeding is common. **Significant or sentinel bleeding may herald a tracheo-innominate artery fistula** — rare, catastrophic, and most likely in the weeks after insertion. It is a surgical emergency; the herald bleed is the warning that precedes exsanguination.

> [!note] Scope. This block orients an intern who is called to a tracheostomy problem. **`tracheostomy` had exactly one occurrence in this vault before it** — the definition line above — so there was no emergency content at all. The authoritative algorithms are the NTSP ones; follow those.

## Regional / Local Anaesthesia

Divided into peripheral nerve blocks and neuraxial anaesthesia (further divided into spinal & epidural).

### Peripheral nerve blocks

**Local anaesthetics (LA):** lidocaine, bupivacaine, prilocaine
- Long-acting: bupivacaine (also takes longer to work), levobupivacaine, ropivacaine
- Middle-acting: lidocaine (especially good for mucous membranes), prilocaine, mepivacaine
- Short-acting: procaine

Adrenaline can be mixed in — causes vasoconstriction so LA remains at the injection site longer (more effective) and allows higher LA doses (lower risk of systemic entry). Can be used to block specific nerves (e.g. femoral nerve block for neck-of-femur fracture) or injected at incision sites during surgery.

### Risks of local anaesthetics

> [!danger] Systemic distribution (LA accidentally injected intravenously)
> **S/Smx:** perioral tingling, tongue numbness, lightheadedness, tinnitus; if severe — seizures, apnoea, cardiac depression, coma
> **Mx:** stop LA; 20% lipid emulsion (Intralipid — binds to LA in circulation); resuscitate as necessary (may require intubation, ventilation); seizure management

Other risks: failure, nerve injury, bleeding.

### Neuraxial blocks
Injection of anaesthetic (e.g. LA, opioids) into the epidural or subarachnoid space.
- Injection level should be around L3/L4. L4/L5 level can be estimated as the line between the iliac crests.
- Not higher — spinal cord ends ~L1; increased risk of transecting spinal cord.
- Needle passes through: skin → subcutaneous fat → supraspinous ligament → interspinous ligament → ligamentum flavum → epidural space (epidural needle stops here) → dura mater → arachnoid mater → subarachnoid space (spinal needle stops here)
- Sterile procedure (requires scrubbing in)
- Local anaesthetic usually given to skin and surrounding soft tissue before the needle is advanced
- Blocks tested using cold spray to determine the dermatomal level at which the block ends

> [!danger] Absolute contraindications to neuraxial anaesthesia
> Anticoagulant states (increased risk of bleeding at the cord — see the Pre-op instructions section above for the specific timing thresholds by anticoagulant class, since "anticoagulated" isn't a single fixed exclusion but depends on which drug and how recently it was stopped); local sepsis (risk of CSF infection); shock or hypovolaemic states; raised ICP (risk of coning); unwilling or uncooperative patient (risk to patient and staff); fixed output states (e.g. mitral and aortic stenosis)

### Epidural anaesthetic
- Epidural space is larger than the subarachnoid space, requiring a larger volume of anaesthetic
- Can be given as a single dose, or via catheter connected to continuous infusion or patient-controlled analgesia (PCA)
- Usually given in labour for pregnancy, as the catheter can stay in for continuous anaesthesia

**Risks:**
- Dural puncture headache — Mx with caffeine and oral fluids, bed rest, analgesia; if headache >24–48h, blood patch (small amount of patient's own blood introduced into CSF space to patch the puncture)
- Vessel puncture and inadvertent injection — Mx with resuscitation (symptomatic)
- Hypoventilation due to motor block of intercostal muscles — may require ventilation
- Inadvertent spinal anaesthesia (large volume injected into CSF — near-total spinal block) — requires resuscitation
- Epidural haematoma/abscess — requires urgent neuro referral

### Spinal anaesthetic
- Aims to anaesthetise the spinal roots passing through the space
- Single dose — only suitable for short procedures (may wear out otherwise)

**Risks:**
- Some lightheadedness and ↓BP — conservative Mx
- Total spinal block (↓HR, ↓BP, anxiety, apnoea, loss of consciousness) — requires urgent resuscitation
- Headache (possibly from dural puncture)
- Urinary retention
- Permanent neurological damage (rare)

---

## Post-Operative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV)

**R:**
- Patient factors: F>M (3:1), previous history of PONV, obesity, motion sickness, pre-op anxiety
- Anaesthesia factors: opioids (especially morphine), nitrous oxide, etomidate, ketamine, volatile agents (TIVA with propofol reduces PONV risk)
- Surgery type: GI, GU, gynaecological, neurosurgery, ENT (specifically middle ear), ophthalmic
- Post-op factors: dehydration, ↓BP, hypoxia, early oral intake

**P:** common pathway is stimulation of the vomiting centre in the medulla, itself stimulated by:
- Higher centres (sensory input, personality, anxiety)
- Chemoreceptor trigger zone (drugs)
- Somatic and visceral afferents
- Middle ear/labyrinth (e.g. motion)

**Mx:**
- Reduce anxiety before the operation
- Reduce risk factors (e.g. hydration, oxygenation)
- Good prevention of PONV, especially in patients with known risk factors, using antiemetics (e.g. ondansetron, cyclizine)

> [!info] Verified against the Australian Society of Anaesthetists' published perspective on the Fourth Consensus Guidelines for PONV management (Anaesthesia and Intensive Care), Aug 2026 — cyclizine genuinely is used in Australia for PONV prophylaxis/treatment (unlike some other jurisdictions where it's been discontinued), so no correction needed to the drug choices above; adding the current AU-specific dosing/practice detail that wasn't in the source note.
> **Multimodal prophylaxis recommended for all patients with ≥1 risk factor** (not reserved only for high-risk patients) — combine agents from different classes for better effect than a single agent.
> **First-line agents and current AU-consensus doses:** dexamethasone 4–8mg IV at induction (dose range increased from the previous 4–5mg in earlier guideline iterations — no clinically significant blood glucose effect even in diabetic patients from a single dose); ondansetron 4mg IV (or 8mg oral dissolving tablet); granisetron 0.35–3mg IV as an alternative 5-HT3 antagonist; low-dose droperidol (<1mg, e.g. 0.625mg IV) also effective and commonly used in Australian practice at this low dose without the sedation/QT concerns associated with higher historical doses.

## Pre-Operative Assessment

> [!note] Gap-filled from CSV ("Pre operation assessment," Medium yield) — genuinely absent despite being fundamental to safe anaesthetic practice; the ASA classification and fasting guidance were already referenced elsewhere in this source but the assessment framework itself was never built.

**D:** the systematic clinical evaluation of a patient before anaesthesia/surgery, aiming to identify factors that increase perioperative risk, optimise modifiable conditions where possible, and plan the anaesthetic approach accordingly.

**History:**
- **Presenting surgical condition** and planned procedure — informs anaesthetic technique, positioning, expected blood loss/fluid shifts, and duration.
- **Past anaesthetic history** — previous anaesthetics and any complications (difficult intubation, PONV, awareness, prolonged recovery), family history of anaesthetic complications (specifically screening for malignant hyperthermia susceptibility — see General Anaesthesia above for the fuller detail on this emergency, not repeated here — and pseudocholinesterase deficiency, relevant to suxamethonium metabolism).
- **Medical comorbidities** — cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, hepatic, and endocrine disease all carry specific perioperative implications; diabetes specifically has a comprehensive dedicated management pathway — see [[06_Metabolic_Medicine_and_Endocrinology]] Perioperative Diabetes Management for the full AU-verified detail (the ADS-ANZCA national guideline), not repeated here.
- **Medications** — full medication reconciliation, since several classes need specific perioperative adjustment (anticoagulants, antiplatelets, diabetes medications, and others) — see General Anaesthesia above for the AU-verified DOAC/warfarin perioperative timing and bridging detail, not repeated here.
- **Allergies** — drug allergies specifically, and any history of anaphylaxis under a previous anaesthetic (raising suspicion for a specific anaesthetic-related allergen, e.g. neuromuscular blocking agents, latex, or chlorhexidine).
- **Fasting status** — see the "Sip Til Send" ANZCA PG07 (2024) guidance already established elsewhere in this source, not repeated here.
- **Airway history** — previous difficult intubation, obstructive sleep apnoea, limited neck mobility, dental issues — directly informs airway management planning.
- **Social history** — smoking (increases perioperative respiratory complication risk; cessation even shortly before surgery has some benefit), alcohol use (relevant to withdrawal risk and anaesthetic drug interactions), and functional capacity (a practical, low-cost way to estimate cardiovascular reserve — the ability to climb ≥2 flights of stairs or achieve ≥4 METs of exertion without symptoms is a widely used threshold suggesting adequate reserve for most non-cardiac surgery without further cardiac work-up).

**Examination:** general examination with particular attention to the airway (see Airway Adjuncts above for the specific airway assessment features relevant to predicting a difficult airway, not repeated here), cardiovascular and respiratory systems, and any specific findings relevant to the planned procedure or identified comorbidities.

> [!info] ASA Physical Status Classification — a widely used, simple system summarising overall perioperative risk, referenced throughout this source
> **ASA I:** normal healthy patient | **ASA II:** mild systemic disease (e.g. well-controlled hypertension, smoker) | **ASA III:** severe systemic disease, not life-threatening (e.g. poorly controlled diabetes, stable angina) | **ASA IV:** severe systemic disease that is a constant threat to life (e.g. recent MI, severe heart failure) | **ASA V:** moribund, not expected to survive without the operation | **ASA VI:** declared brain-dead, organs being harvested. An "E" suffix denotes emergency surgery, which independently increases risk regardless of the underlying ASA class.

**Ix:** investigations should be **targeted to the history/examination findings and the planned procedure, not ordered routinely/reflexively** — a genuinely important modern principle, since indiscriminate pre-operative testing in low-risk patients undergoing low-risk procedures doesn't improve outcomes and can generate false-positive findings that delay surgery unnecessarily. Common targeted investigations include:
- **FBC** — if anaemia is suspected, significant blood loss is anticipated, or as a baseline before major surgery.
- **U&Es** — if renal impairment is known/suspected, in patients on medications affecting electrolytes (diuretics, ACEI/ARB), or before major surgery with expected significant fluid shifts.
- **Coagulation studies** — if a bleeding history is present, the patient is anticoagulated, or significant blood loss is anticipated.
- **Group & hold/crossmatch** — see Group & Hold / Crossmatch below for the fuller detail, not repeated here.
- **ECG** — for patients with known cardiac disease, significant cardiovascular risk factors, or as a baseline before major surgery, particularly in older patients.
- **HbA1c/glucose** — see the diabetes screening detail in [[06_Metabolic_Medicine_and_Endocrinology]] Perioperative Diabetes Management, not repeated here.
- **Pregnancy test** — for people of childbearing potential, given the implications for anaesthetic drug choice and timing.
- **Further cardiac/respiratory work-up** (e.g. echocardiogram, spirometry, cardiology/respiratory referral) — reserved for patients with reduced functional capacity, significant symptoms, or high-risk surgery, rather than routine screening.

**Optimisation:** the pre-operative assessment is also the opportunity to optimise modifiable risk factors before surgery where time allows — e.g. improving glycaemic control in poorly controlled diabetes (see the ADS-ANZCA guideline's specific HbA1c threshold and delay-vs-proceed framework in [[06_Metabolic_Medicine_and_Endocrinology]], not repeated here), treating active infection, optimising heart failure or COPD control, correcting significant anaemia, and smoking cessation advice — all aimed at reducing perioperative risk rather than simply documenting it.

**Consent:** discussing the procedure, anaesthetic technique, and material risks with the patient is a core part of this process — see [[Clinical-Process-EBM-Consent-Capacity]] for the general principles of informed consent, not repeated here.

## Group & Hold / Crossmatch

> [!note] Gap-filled from CSV (Anaesthetics/Perioperative Care category, Low yield) — not covered in the source primer.

**D:** Pre-transfusion testing to determine a patient's blood group and screen for red cell antibodies, done routinely before surgery with any meaningful blood loss risk.

**Group & hold (G&H, also "group & save"):** determines the patient's ABO/Rh(D) group and screens serum for atypical red cell antibodies, but does **not** physically reserve specific blood units — the sample is held (typically valid ~72h if the patient hasn't been recently transfused/pregnant, shorter if they have, given the risk of new antibody formation) so that crossmatching can be done rapidly if blood is later needed. Appropriate for procedures with a low likelihood of significant blood loss.

**Crossmatch (X-match):** physically tests the patient's serum against specific donor units to confirm compatibility before those units are issued and available for transfusion. Appropriate for procedures with an anticipated higher blood loss risk, or urgently if a G&H patient starts bleeding.

> [!tip] Practical distinction: G&H is "just in case," crossmatch is "blood physically reserved and ready." The decision of which to order (and how many units to crossmatch) is typically guided by a **Maximum Surgical Blood Ordering Schedule (MSBOS)** — an institution-specific list mapping each procedure type to the recommended G&H-only vs crossmatch-with-a-specified-unit-count approach, based on typical blood loss for that operation.

**In an emergency where there's no time for group & hold/crossmatch:** O-negative ("universal donor") red cells can be given immediately without waiting for typing — used only when the delay of proper typing would itself be dangerous, since group-specific or fully crossmatched blood is always preferred once available given O-negative supply is limited and reserved for genuine emergencies.

## Assessment and Basic Management of Pain

> [!note] Gap-filled from CSV ("Assessment and Basic Management of Pain," Medium yield, GP/Ethics category). **Verified absent by asking whether an entry *teaches* this, not whether the terms appear** — the distinction that has caught three prior misclassifications in this project. Zero corpus-wide hits for "analgesic ladder" or "pain assessment"; "neuropathic pain" appeared only as a *symptom* of other diseases or as an indication for amitriptyline; and [[10_11c_Oncology_-_Palliative_Care_Prescribing]] General principles covers opioid dosing and conversion in the **palliative** context without teaching general assessment.
>
> **Placement note — this overrides the queue's allocation.** The N6 remainder table assigned this row to `19_General_Practice_and_Preventive_Medicine`, but that file's declared scope is general practice as a discipline and preventive care as a system; pain assessment is neither, and putting it there would repeat the error of using a new file as a convenient container. Built here instead: ANZCA is the Australian college for acute pain medicine, this file has already had an ANZCA-focused localisation pass, and it already carries regional anaesthesia and postoperative care.
>
> Verified against ANZCA position statement **PS41(G) Acute Pain Management (2023)** and the ACSQHC **Opioid Analgesic Stewardship in Acute Pain Clinical Care Standard (2022)**, Aug 2026.

### Assessment

**Characterise the pain** — SOCRATES or PQRST as the structure (see [[History-Taking]] Chest Pain for the SOCRATES framework applied in full, not repeated here). Then classify it, because **the class determines which drugs will work**:

| Type | Mechanism | Typical description | Responds to |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Nociceptive** | Tissue injury activating intact nociceptors | Sharp, aching, throbbing; well localised (somatic) or vague and referred (visceral) | Paracetamol, NSAIDs, opioids |
| **Neuropathic** | Damage or disease of the somatosensory nervous system itself | Burning, shooting, electric-shock; with allodynia or numbness in a neuroanatomical distribution | **Poorly responsive to opioids**; needs tricyclics or gabapentinoids |
| **Nociplastic** | Altered central processing without identifiable tissue or nerve damage | Widespread, disproportionate to findings | Multimodal, non-pharmacological emphasis |

> [!info] **Why the classification is not academic: neuropathic pain responds poorly to opioids, and the mechanism explains why.** Opioids act on receptors in a nociceptive pathway that is intact; in neuropathic pain the pathway itself is damaged and generating signal independently, so escalating the opioid dose adds side effects without adding analgesia. **A patient whose pain is not responding to increasing opioid doses may not need more opioid — they may need a different class.** Recognising that is the single highest-value thing this classification buys an intern.

**Measure severity** with a numerical rating or visual analogue scale — but **pair it with function**, which is the more useful measure and the more reliable one: *can they cough, deep-breathe, mobilise, sleep?* A patient reporting 8/10 who is sleeping comfortably and one reporting 6/10 who cannot take a deep breath are different clinical problems, and the functional question distinguishes them.

**Reassess after every intervention.** A pain score recorded once is an observation; recorded before and after treatment it becomes evidence of whether the treatment worked.

> [!warning] **Patients who cannot self-report are the ones most often under-treated** — advanced dementia, delirium, intubation, intellectual disability, very young children. **Absence of complaint is not absence of pain.** Use an observational/behavioural tool (facial expression, vocalisation, body language, guarding, changes in behaviour or agitation) rather than assuming comfort. In an older person with dementia, **new agitation should prompt a search for pain** alongside the other precipitants (see [[04_Neurology]] Delirium, not repeated here).

### Management

**Multimodal analgesia is the organising principle**, and its logic is worth stating rather than the drug list alone: **combining agents that act by different mechanisms gives better analgesia at lower doses of each, and specifically reduces the opioid requirement and therefore opioid-related harm.** Paracetamol and an NSAID are not "weak" options to be skipped on the way to an opioid — they are the base the opioid sits on, and omitting them means using more opioid than necessary.

**The WHO analgesic ladder** — three steps, each ± adjuvants:
1. **Non-opioid** — paracetamol ± NSAID
2. **Weak opioid** — e.g. codeine, tramadol
3. **Strong opioid** — e.g. morphine, oxycodone, hydromorphone

> [!tip] **Two things about the ladder that are usually left out.** It was developed for **cancer pain**, where pain escalates over time, so it is climbed upwards. **In acute severe pain it is used in reverse** — start at the step the pain warrants and step *down* as it settles. Starting a patient with a fractured femur on paracetamol because it is "step 1" misapplies the tool. And **adjuvants are not a fourth step** — they run alongside every step, and for neuropathic pain they are the primary treatment rather than an addition.

**Opioid stewardship** — the ACSQHC clinical care standard exists because acute-pain opioid prescribing is a recognised source of long-term harm:
- **Non-opioid analgesia first and always alongside**, not instead of.
- **Immediate-release, not modified-release**, for acute pain — modified-release preparations are associated with greater harm in this setting and are harder to titrate.
- **Shortest effective duration**, with a **plan and an endpoint** stated at the time of prescribing rather than left open.
- **Do not discharge with an opioid script by default.** Where one is genuinely needed, supply a small quantity with an explicit stopping plan and tell the GP.
- Prescribe a **laxative with any regular opioid** — constipation is the side effect that persists rather than resolving (already established in [[10_11c_Oncology_-_Palliative_Care_Prescribing]] General principles).

**Non-pharmacological measures are part of the plan, not a substitute for it**: positioning and splinting, ice or heat, immobilisation of a fracture, treating the cause (drainage, reduction, catheterisation for retention), explanation and reassurance, and physiotherapy.

**Special populations:** **start low and go slow in the elderly** (reduced renal and hepatic clearance, greater sensitivity — see [[18_Geriatrics_and_Older_Persons_Health]] Polypharmacy and Deprescribing for the fall-risk consequences of getting this wrong); **opioid-tolerant patients need their baseline requirement continued *plus* additional analgesia** for the new acute pain, and withholding it is a common and avoidable error; renal impairment alters opioid choice.

> [!danger] **Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients are demonstrably under-treated for pain, and one of the documented causes is a clinician belief rather than a system barrier.** Australian research finds the musculoskeletal pain burden around **1.4 times higher**, pain **under-reported and under-treated**, and — in the pre-hospital setting — Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients **less likely to receive IV access or analgesia**. A specific, correctable contributor identified in that literature is the **unfounded clinician belief that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are "more stoic"**, which converts an under-report into an under-treatment.
> Two practical consequences: **do not calibrate analgesia to how much the patient complains** — use the functional questions above, which do not depend on expressed distress; and be aware that **standard pain scales may lack cultural relevance or feel uncomfortable**, so a low score on a numerical scale should not close the assessment.

## Postoperative Care and Complications

> [!note] Gap-filled from CSV (Anaesthetics/Perioperative Care category, Medium yield, "partially covered" via the PONV section above) — general postoperative complications beyond PONV weren't covered in the source primer.

**Immediate recovery (PACU/recovery room):** airway/breathing/circulation monitoring until the patient meets discharge criteria (stable observations, adequate pain control, minimal nausea, able to protect their own airway); regular observations per local protocol.

### Common postoperative complications by timing

**Immediate (within hours):**
- Airway obstruction/hypoventilation — residual anaesthetic/paralytic effect; manage with airway manoeuvres, reversal agents if paralysis-related (see neostigmine above), escalate to re-intubation if needed
- Hypotension — commonly from residual anaesthetic vasodilation, bleeding, or (rarely) anaphylaxis; assess and treat the specific cause rather than fluids alone
- Pain — undertreated pain itself contributes to other complications (tachycardia, hypertension, delayed mobilisation) — a standing priority in recovery, not an afterthought
- PONV — see dedicated section above

> [!danger] Added from unverified layer — **tachycardia with hypotension in the first 24 hours is BLEEDING until excluded**
> `SRC:A1_Emergency_-_Deteriorating_Patient__Sepsis__Cardiac_Arrest §0.4` `UNVERIFIED — model knowledge, not source-checked.`
> The hypotension line above lists bleeding among the causes. **The default assumption should be
> bleeding, not one option among three.** Do not attribute early post-operative tachycardia and
> hypotension to **pain, anxiety or residual anaesthetic effect** without examining **the wound,
> the drains and the abdomen**, and checking a haemoglobin. A young patient compensates until
> they do not, so **a normal blood pressure with a rising heart rate is the abnormal
> observation** — see [[NEW_Cardiology_and_Vascular]] on shock phenotypes.

**Early (first few post-op days):**
> [!fail]- CONFLICT CF-035 — atelectasis as a cause of early post-operative fever **R2**
> **A (`inherited`):** the 5 W's below place **W**ind first — *"atelectasis/pneumonia — **most common cause in the first 24–48h**"* — and the bullet after it treats atelectasis as the thing to prevent.
> **B (`unverified`):** `SRC:K1_Fever_Workup §0.6` — *"atelectasis as a cause of fever is **poorly supported by evidence** despite being taught for decades — it is **associated with** early post-operative fever rather than **causing** it, and attributing fever to atelectasis can **delay finding the real source**."*
> **Why it matters:** this is not a naming dispute. If atelectasis is the answer, the early post-operative fever is explained and the patient gets spirometry and mobilisation. If it is only an association, the fever is still unexplained and the search continues — and the sources that present in the same window are pneumonia, aspiration, a transfusion reaction, malignant hyperthermia, and an infection that predated the operation. The difference is whether a CT gets ordered.
> **Note:** both sides agree atelectasis is *common* after surgery and that mobilisation and deep breathing are correct care. The dispute is causation of the fever, not management of the lung.
> **Resolve against:** ANZCA professional documents on post-operative care · the RACS perioperative resources · a current Australian surgical or anaesthetic text. Not resolvable from this corpus, and not resolved here.

- Fever — a useful clinical approach is the "5 W's" mnemonic: **W**ind (atelectasis/pneumonia — most common cause in the first 24–48h), **W**ater (UTI, typically day 3–5), **W**alking (DVT/PE, typically day 5+), **W**ound (surgical site infection, typically day 5–7), **W**onder drugs (drug fever/reaction — consider at any time)
- Atelectasis — encourage early mobilisation, deep breathing exercises/incentive spirometry, adequate analgesia (pain itself causes shallow breathing and atelectasis)
- VTE (DVT/PE) — see [[01_Cardiovascular]] Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE) (two separate sections, 0.28 and 0.29) for full disease-level content; perioperative VTE prophylaxis (mechanical — TED stockings/intermittent pneumatic compression, ± pharmacological LMWH depending on procedure-specific bleeding-vs-thrombosis risk balance) is a standard part of postoperative care, not an optional extra
- Surgical site infection — see wound-specific content below
- Ileus — see [[03_Gastrointestinal]] Ileus for full disease-level content; common and usually self-limiting after abdominal surgery specifically

> [!danger] Added from unverified layer — **anastomotic leak, and the patient who is "not progressing"**
> `SRC:A1_Emergency_-_Deteriorating_Patient__Sepsis__Cardiac_Arrest §0.4` `UNVERIFIED — model knowledge, not source-checked. The timing window, per a named surgical source.`
> Around **days 3 to 7** after bowel surgery, an anastomotic leak presents as **tachycardia, a
> low-grade fever, ileus, and a patient who is simply "not progressing"** — **not** as obvious
> peritonitis. It is mistaken for the ileus listed above, which is exactly why it is missed.
> **New post-operative atrial fibrillation is a recognised early sign** and should prompt a
> search for a surgical cause rather than rate control alone — see [[01_Cardiovascular]] §0.4,
> where post-operative state is listed among the acute precipitants of AF.
> Investigation is **CT with contrast**; see [[NEW_Investigations_Gastroenterology]], which
> names suspected anastomotic leak as the setting where barium is contraindicated.

**Wound-specific complications:**
- Infection (surgical site infection) — erythema, warmth, discharge, fever, typically day 5–7; Mx per severity — oral/IV antibiotics ± wound drainage
- Dehiscence — wound edges separating, may be superficial or full-thickness (the latter a surgical emergency, especially if bowel/fascia involved); risk factors include infection, poor nutrition, obesity, smoking, steroid use
- Haematoma/seroma — fluid/blood collection under the wound; may need drainage if large/symptomatic

**Chronic/long-term:**
- Chronic post-surgical pain — a recognised complication of many procedure types, more likely with nerve injury during surgery, poorly controlled acute post-op pain, and certain procedure types (e.g. thoracotomy, hernia repair, amputation)
- Hypertrophic/keloid scarring
- Adhesions (following abdominal/pelvic surgery) — can cause chronic pain, subfertility, or later present as small bowel obstruction (see [[03_Gastrointestinal]] Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO))

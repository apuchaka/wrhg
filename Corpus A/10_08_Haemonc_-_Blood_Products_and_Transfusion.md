## Warfarin — management of high INR

> [!danger] Stop warfarin in ALL patients with an elevated INR requiring management.

> [!info] Verified against the Australasian Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis consensus guidelines (MJA) and Australian Red Cross Lifeblood clinical guidance, Aug 2026 — the AU-specific INR-banding and doses differ meaningfully from the UK figures this entry previously carried (the table that follows is the Australian management), and there's a genuinely current supply-chain change worth knowing: **Australia transitioned from Prothrombinex-VF (a 3-factor PCC) to Beriplex (a 4-factor PCC) as the standard PCC for warfarin reversal in June 2024** — 4-factor PCC contains all four vitamin K-dependent factors (II, VII, IX, X) at adequate concentration, so **FFP is no longer routinely needed alongside PCC** the way it sometimes was with the older 3-factor product (which lacked adequate factor VII) — a genuine, recent change from older teaching that specified PCC + FFP together. Target INR for most indications (VTE, single mechanical valve excluding mitral) is 2–3; mechanical mitral valve or other high-thrombotic-risk indications may have a higher target (not detailed here).

| Scenario | Australian management |
|---|---|
| **Major bleeding, or urgent surgery/procedure needed** | IV Vitamin K1 5–10mg + PCC (Beriplex/4-factor PCC — see note above; FFP not routinely required with 4-factor PCC, unlike older 3-factor protocols) |
| **INR >9, bleeding absent, high risk of bleeding** | Cease warfarin; IV Vitamin K1 1mg; consider PCC + FFP; recheck INR in 6–12h; resume warfarin at a reduced dose once INR <5 |
| **INR >9, bleeding absent, low risk of bleeding** | Cease warfarin; Vitamin K1 2.5–5mg PO (or 1mg IV); recheck INR in 6–12h; resume warfarin at a reduced dose once INR <5 |
| **INR 4.5–10, bleeding absent, no high bleeding risk** | Withholding warfarin alone, with careful subsequent monitoring, is considered safe — Vitamin K may not be needed in this band specifically |
| **Any INR + bleeding present, not classified as "major"** | Individualised — generally follows the same principle as the major-bleeding row above but with clinical judgement on PCC necessity based on bleeding severity |

## ABO and Rh Compatibility — The Two Opposite Rules

> [!note] Gap-filled — the "universal donor is AB blood" statement below (in the FFP section) is correct **specifically for plasma**, but is exactly the kind of statement that gets confused with the opposite rule for red cells if the underlying logic isn't explained — this entry provides that logic once, given both rules recur throughout this file.

**The core principle: ABO compatibility is about which antigens are present on the cells and which antibodies are present in the plasma — and red cells and plasma have opposite compatibility rules, precisely because it's the *other* component (antigens vs antibodies) that matters for each.**

> [!info] Red cells — matching AVOIDS giving antigens the recipient has antibodies against
> - **Type O red cells have neither A nor B antigens** — since there's nothing on the cell surface for the recipient's own anti-A/anti-B antibodies to react against, **O red cells can be given to any ABO recipient** — making **O the universal red cell donor**.
> - Conversely, **type AB red cells carry both A and B antigens** — an AB recipient has neither anti-A nor anti-B antibodies (since their own cells carry both antigens), so **AB recipients can receive red cells of any ABO type** — making **AB the universal red cell recipient**.

> [!info] Plasma — the opposite logic, because plasma is being matched by its antibody content instead
> - **Type AB plasma contains neither anti-A nor anti-B antibodies** — since an AB person's own cells carry both antigens, their plasma was never exposed to develop antibodies against either — so **AB plasma can be given to any ABO recipient without triggering a reaction against the recipient's own red cell antigens**, making **AB the universal plasma donor** (the statement already in the FFP section above, now with the reasoning behind it).
> - Conversely, **type O plasma contains both anti-A and anti-B antibodies** (since a type O person's own cells carry neither antigen, their immune system develops antibodies against both) — so **only type O recipients can safely receive type O plasma**, making **O recipients the most restricted for plasma specifically** — genuinely the opposite pattern from red cells, where O is the most flexible donor.

**Rh(D) compatibility — a separate system, layered on top of ABO:** Rh-negative individuals lack the RhD antigen and can develop anti-D antibodies if exposed to RhD-positive blood (via transfusion or, in pregnancy, via fetomaternal exposure — see [[16_01-05_Antenatal_Care]] for the anti-D prophylaxis detail this underlies, not repeated here) — **Rh-negative blood is preferred whenever the recipient's Rh status is unknown or when transfusing Rh-negative individuals specifically**, given the risk of sensitisation with future exposures (transfusion reactions or, for a person capable of pregnancy, haemolytic disease of the newborn in a future pregnancy).

**Practical relevance:** this is why **O-negative red cells are the true "universal donor" blood** referenced in emergency transfusion contexts (see [[03a_Anaesthetics_Primer]] Group & Hold / Crossmatch for the emergency O-negative use principle, not repeated here) — combining the universal-donor property for both the ABO (O) and Rh (negative) systems simultaneously.

## Blood products

### Packed red cells

- Each unit is ~300mL — whole blood is collected from the donor, then plasma is removed.
- Each bag should raise the patient's Hb by approximately 10 g/L (3% haematocrit).
- Requires group & save (G&S) and cross-match before administration.
- Store at 4°C prior to infusion. In a non-urgent scenario, a unit of RBCs is usually transfused over 90–120 minutes. Shelf life ~42 days.

**Indications for giving:**
- Acute major haemorrhage.
- Regular transfusions for chronic anaemia.
- In most other settings, transfusion thresholds: patients without acute coronary syndrome (e.g. STEMI) — <70 g/L; patients with ACS — <80 g/L.

### Platelets

- Platelet-rich plasma, or platelet concentrate (via high speed centrifugation).

> [!warning] Platelets carry the highest risk of bacterial contamination compared to other blood products.

**Indications for giving:**
- Active bleeding — platelets <30 ×10⁹ with clinically significant bleeding (e.g. melaena); platelets <100 ×10⁹ with severe bleeding or bleeding at critical sites (e.g. CNS).
- Before an invasive procedure — aim for >50 ×10⁹ in most patients; >50–75 if high risk of bleeding; >100 if surgery at a critical site.
- If no active bleeding or planned invasive procedure, the threshold for platelet transfusion is <10 ×10⁹ if there are no alternatives.

### CMV-negative and irradiated blood

> [!info] Indications for CMV-negative blood
> - Granulocyte transfusions
> - Intra-uterine transfusions
> - Neonates ≤28 days post expected date of delivery
> - Pregnancy — elective transfusions during pregnancy (not during labour or delivery)

> [!info] Indications for irradiated blood
> - Granulocyte transfusions
> - Intra-uterine transfusions
> - Neonates ≤28 days post expected date of delivery
> - Bone marrow or stem cell transplants
> - Immunocompromised (e.g. chemotherapy or congenital — but not HIV)
> - Patients with current or previous Hodgkin lymphoma

> [!tip] CMV-negative blood is essentially blood without leucocytes, as CMV is transmitted in leucocytes. Irradiated blood products are depleted of T cells, and are used to avoid transfusion-associated graft versus host disease.

### Fresh frozen plasma (FFP)

- Each unit is ~150–220mL. In warfarin reversal, 30mL/kg is needed — give along with ≥1L fluid in a 70kg person (caution in fluid overload states; may not be suitable).
- Prepared from single units of blood. Contains clotting factors, albumin and immunoglobulin.
- Requires G&S and cross-match before administration. Universal donor is AB blood.

**Indications for giving:**
- Patients with clinically significant but non-major haemorrhage with a PT:APTT ratio >1.5.
- Prophylaxis for surgery if there is significant risk of bleeding.

### Cryoprecipitate

- Each unit is 15–20mL. FFP is centrifuged → the liquid that remains on top (supernatant) is cryoprecipitate.
- Contains Factor VIII and fibrinogen among other clotting factors — clinically used to replace fibrinogen.
- Requires G&S and cross-match before administration.

**Indications for giving:**
- Patients with clinically significant but non-major haemorrhage with fibrinogen concentration <1.5 g/L (e.g. DIC, liver failure).
- Emergency situations for haemophiliacs and von Willebrand disease.
- Prophylaxis for surgery if there is significant risk of bleeding and fibrinogen <1.0 g/L.

### Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC)

- Aka factor IX complex — a 4-factor PCC containing factors II, VII, IX and X at therapeutic concentration (Beriplex is the current standard Australian product, replacing the older 3-factor Prothrombinex-VF in June 2024 — see the Warfarin Reversal section above for the fuller detail, not repeated here).
- Dose: Beriplex 50 U/kg.
- Main indication is emergency reversal of anticoagulation in patients with severe bleeding or head injury with suspected intracranial haemorrhage.
- Rarely used for prophylaxis.

### Cell saver devices

- Device collects the patient's blood during surgery and re-infuses it — some devices wash the RBCs prior to re-infusion (↓risk of contamination) but are more expensive.
- May be acceptable to Jehovah's Witnesses.
- Contraindicated in malignant disease due to risk of increased disease dissemination.

## Massive Transfusion Protocol (MTP)

> [!note] Gap-filled — despite the individual blood products above being thoroughly built, the coordinated protocol tying them together for critical bleeding was genuinely absent, referenced only in passing elsewhere in this project as a cause of dilutional coagulopathy. Verified against Australian Red Cross Lifeblood's "Management of critical bleeding" clinical guidance, Aug 2026.

- **D:** a predefined, coordinated hospital protocol for the rapid, balanced delivery of blood products in critical/life-threatening haemorrhage — activated to prevent the delays inherent in ordering products individually as a crisis unfolds. Massive transfusion is typically defined as ≥10 units of RBC within 24 hours, or transfusion of half the patient's blood volume within 4 hours, or a full blood volume within 24 hours (adult blood volume ≈70mL/kg).
- **Activation criteria:** life-threatening haemorrhage with a genuine or anticipated need for large-volume transfusion — activated on clinical judgement and anticipated trajectory, not only once a fixed unit-count threshold has already been reached, given the entire purpose is to get ahead of a deteriorating situation rather than react to it.

> [!info] Ratio-based product delivery — the genuinely important Australian-specific point: Lifeblood's institutional guidance specifies **no fewer than 4 units of FFP and 1 adult unit of platelets for every 8 units of RBC** — a minimum ratio framing, distinct from (though broadly in the same direction as) the "1:1:1" ratio more commonly cited internationally from the PROPPR trial. Local Health Districts/hospitals customise this into a site-specific MTP with predefined product "packs," so the exact configuration genuinely varies by institution — check the local protocol rather than assuming a fixed national number. **Viscoelastic haemostatic assay (VHA)-guided algorithms** are an accepted alternative to fixed ratio-based dosing where locally available, allowing product delivery to be tailored to the patient's actual measured coagulation status rather than a predefined ratio alone.
> - **Fibrinogen replacement:** usual adult target dose 3–4g, achievable via cryoprecipitate (10 units whole-blood-equivalent) or fibrinogen concentrate per local protocol; allow up to 30 minutes thawing time for FFP/cryoprecipitate — a genuinely practical logistic point, given this delay needs to be anticipated rather than discovered mid-crisis.
> - **Platelets:** thrombocytopenia <50×10⁹/L can be anticipated after two blood-volume equivalents of replacement, from dilution and consumption — aim to keep platelets >50×10⁹/L (higher thresholds for intracranial/spinal bleeding, consistent with the general platelet transfusion thresholds already established above, not repeated here); usual adult platelet dose is 1 unit.

- **Practical/logistic principles beyond the product ratios themselves:**
  - **Communication between the clinical team and the transfusion laboratory is genuinely critical**, not a secondary administrative concern — MTP is as much a logistics protocol as a clinical one, and delays or miscommunication directly translate into delayed product availability during active haemorrhage.
  - **Treat the underlying cause of bleeding concurrently** — MTP replaces lost blood volume and coagulation factors, but doesn't itself stop the bleeding; definitive haemorrhage control (surgical, interventional radiological, obstetric per [[16_14-15_Obstetric_Emergencies]] Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH), not repeated here) must proceed in parallel, not be delayed while transfusion catches up.
  - **Paediatric/neonatal patients require age-specific institutional protocols** for both activation criteria and product dosing — adult ratios and activation thresholds don't transfer directly, given different blood volumes and different tolerance of the products involved.
- **A genuinely important caution on activation accuracy:** MTP over-activation causes blood product wastage; under-activation risks patient morbidity/mortality from inadequate resuscitation — neither clinical judgement alone nor current scoring systems reliably achieve optimal activation accuracy, which is precisely why predefined institutional criteria (rather than case-by-case discretion alone) are used, even though they remain imperfect.

## Blood product transfusion complications

> [!danger] Acute haemolytic reaction — acute onset of intravascular haemolysis due to ABO-incompatible blood transfusion, resulting in complement activation and an inflammatory cascade; RBC destruction secondary to IgM antibodies. S/Smx: onset within minutes of transfusion — fever, abdominal pain, hypotension; if severe, DIC, ARDS. Mx: stop transfusion, check blood product (identity, blood type, Coombs test), repeat cross-match, fluid resuscitation.

> [!warning] Non-haemolytic febrile reaction — acute onset immune-mediated reaction to blood products. A/P: antibodies against fragments from cells (possible contamination) or WCC, formation of immune complexes. Associated with RCC transfusion (1–2%), platelet transfusions (10–30%). S/Smx: fever, chills. Mx: slow or stop transfusion, paracetamol, and monitor.

> [!tip] Minor allergic reaction — acute onset of minor allergic reaction, possibly due to foreign plasma proteins. S/Smx: pruritus, urticaria. Mx: temporarily stop transfusion, antihistamines, monitor.

> [!danger] Anaphylactic reaction — acute onset of IgE-mediated major allergic reaction. Anaphylactoid reaction in patients with IgA deficiency who have anti-IgA antibodies. S/Smx: hypotension (shock), dyspnoea, wheezing, angioedema. Mx: stop transfusion, IM adrenaline, oxygen, fluid resuscitation.

> [!danger] Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) — non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, possibly secondary to ↑vascular permeability due to host neutrophils being activated by substances in donated blood. S/Smx: hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates on CXR, fever, ↓BP. Mx: stop transfusion, O2, support as needed.

> [!warning] Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) — hypervolaemia secondary to excessive transfusion, seen especially in patients with predisposing conditions such as heart failure. S/Smx: pulmonary oedema, ↑BP. Mx: slow or stop transfusion, consider IV furosemide, support as needed.

## Anaphylaxis

> [!note] Gap-filled — despite being referenced across 9 different files throughout this project (Insect bites, blood transfusion reactions, hereditary angioedema differential, anaesthetic emergencies, ABCDE assessment), anaphylaxis had never been built as its own dedicated entry. Given its close relationship to the urticaria/angioedema entry above, it's built here rather than elsewhere, with other files' brief mentions left as appropriate cross-references rather than duplicated content.

> [!info] Verified against the current ASCIA (Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy) Guidelines for Acute Management of Anaphylaxis (updated 2026) and the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care's Acute Anaphylaxis Clinical Care Standard, Aug 2026 — ASCIA is genuinely the Australian- and New Zealand-specific peak body for this exact guideline, so this entry is built directly from the current Australian primary source rather than adapted from elsewhere.

- **D:** a potentially life-threatening systemic allergic reaction, usually rapid in onset, involving typical skin features (urticarial rash, erythema/flushing, and/or angioedema — see Acute urticaria and angioedema below for the disease-level detail on these individual features, not repeated here) **plus** respiratory and/or cardiovascular and/or persistent severe gastrointestinal involvement — or, separately, any acute-onset hypotension, bronchospasm, or upper airway obstruction where anaphylaxis is considered possible, **even if typical skin features are absent** — a genuinely important point, since waiting for a rash to appear before considering anaphylaxis can delay recognition in a presentation without skin involvement.
- **A/P:** usually IgE-mediated mast cell/basophil degranulation triggered by an allergen (food, drug, insect venom, latex among others), though non-IgE-mediated mechanisms exist too; the clinical picture reflects the downstream effects of mediator release (histamine and others) — vasodilation and increased vascular permeability (hypotension, angioedema), bronchospasm, and increased mucus secretion.
- **S/Smx:** rapid onset (typically minutes, though can be delayed depending on the trigger and route of exposure) of urticaria/flushing/angioedema **plus** one or more of: respiratory (stridor, wheeze, dyspnoea, throat/chest tightness), cardiovascular (hypotension, dizziness, collapse — **persistent dizziness or collapse reflects hypotension and is a genuine red flag**, given a BP drop typically occurs relatively late in the process), or persistent severe GI symptoms (vomiting, abdominal pain). **In infants specifically**, additional/atypical signs include drooling, irritability/clinginess, persistent crying, somnolence, hypotonia, and mottled skin — a genuinely different presentation pattern worth knowing given infants can't verbally report symptoms like throat tightness. **In children, persistent tachycardia is typically the first sign of cardiovascular compromise**, with hypotension a later finding — though tachycardia alone is non-specific (also caused by crying, fever, pain, or as a side effect of adrenaline itself), so it should prompt closer monitoring rather than being diagnostic on its own.
- **Ix:** anaphylaxis is a **clinical diagnosis made and treated immediately, without waiting for any test result** — this is the single most important practical point, given delaying adrenaline to "confirm" the diagnosis is a recognised, avoidable cause of poor outcomes. Serum tryptase (if taken, ideally within 1–2 hours of symptom onset, with a further sample later for comparison) can retrospectively support the diagnosis and is sometimes used where the diagnosis is unclear in retrospect, but has no role in the acute treatment decision. Skin prick testing/specific IgE testing are relevant later, as part of allergy work-up to identify the specific trigger, not during the acute episode.
- **Mx:**
  - **Immediate/acute:** **IM adrenaline into the mid-anterolateral thigh, given immediately on diagnosis or strong suspicion, before any other treatment** — this is the single highest-yield practical point in the entire entry, given adrenaline is first-line and should never be delayed for antihistamines, corticosteroids, or nebulised bronchodilators, none of which treat the underlying anaphylactic process. Subcutaneous or inhaled adrenaline routes are **not** recommended, given they're less effective than IM. **Lay flat (or in the position of comfort if breathing difficulty predominates) rather than upright** — an upright posture is a specifically recognised risk factor for fatal reactions, given it can precipitate or worsen hypotension-related collapse (the same principle as avoiding sudden standing in any hypotensive patient, but specifically flagged as important in anaphylaxis given how quickly it can be fatal). High-flow oxygen; IV fluid bolus for hypotension; call for help early given the potential for rapid deterioration — see the ABCDE Assessment entry in [[Examination]] for the general systematic approach this fits into, not repeated here.

> **Why it matters:** **`0.01 mg/kg` and `0.01 mL/kg` are not the same quantity.** They coincide only at **1:1000**, where 1 mL = 1 mg, and diverge at any other concentration — at 1:10,000 (the arrest presentation) `0.01 mL/kg` delivers **one tenth** of `0.01 mg/kg`. The mg form is concentration-independent; the mL form is correct only because "1:1000" happens to sit beside it. **One of the two is wrong as written.** A reader who carries the mL form to a differently-concentrated ampoule under-doses a child in anaphylaxis.

> **The <7.5 kg row was added during the dose-table unit-and-progression sweep (2026-08-29): the table stopped at 7.5 kg, so a reader following the pointer here for an infant reached a table that did not cover them.** The figure is the one the corpus already held in [[01_Cardiovascular]] Shock (the **Anaphylactic shock** sub-entry); note it sits above what this box's own **0.01 mg/kg** rule would give for a <7.5 kg infant (<75 mcg), because a minimum practical volume is drawn rather than a strictly weight-calculated one — **the exact Australian figure for this band is unverified against ASCIA** (see `PENDING_GUIDELINE_CHECKS.md` **B50**).
>
> **This box was added during the L3 seam audit (2026-08-29) because the number was not here.** [[15_01b_Paeds_-_Anaphylaxis]] pointed to *this* entry "for the exact current thresholds already verified there" and this entry carried no dose at all — a circular cross-reference, for the most time-critical drug dose in the corpus, between two entries that were both individually ASCIA-verified. See `PENDING_GUIDELINE_CHECKS.md` **B43**.

  - **Definitive:** repeat IM adrenaline every 5 minutes if inadequate response — most episodes respond to one or two doses; **refractory anaphylaxis** (inadequate response to repeated IM doses) may require a peripheral IV adrenaline infusion under specialist/critical care guidance, a distinct escalation pathway from standard IM dosing. Antihistamines and corticosteroids may be given as adjuncts once adrenaline has been given, but **never as a substitute for, or before, adrenaline** — a genuinely common and important error to avoid.
  - **Chronic/long-term:** clinical observation for **at least 4 hours after the last adrenaline dose**, given adrenaline's short duration of action means symptoms can recur as it wears off (biphasic reactions are a recognised phenomenon); prescribe an adrenaline injector at discharge for patients at risk of re-exposure (weight-based dosing: 150mcg for 7.5–20kg, 300mcg for ≥20kg, 300mcg or 500mcg from around 12 years old/>50kg — genuinely specific, current ASCIA-recommended thresholds); provide a written ASCIA Action Plan for Anaphylaxis with device-specific instructions, given patients/carers need to be trained on the specific device prescribed; allergen identification and avoidance advice; referral to an allergy/immunology specialist for confirmatory testing and ongoing management, particularly for children or where the trigger isn't already clearly known.

> [!note] See [[15_01b_Paeds_-_Anaphylaxis]] for the paediatric-specific overnight-observation criteria (severe/refractory reaction, history of biphasic reaction, concomitant illness, late-evening presentation) that refine the 4-hour minimum above for children specifically, not repeated here.

Not repeated here.

## Acute urticaria and angioedema

- **D:** urticaria (hives) is a skin condition characterised by erythematous, blanching, oedematous, non-painful, pruritic lesions that typically resolve within 24 hours and leave no residual markings. Angio-oedema is a sudden, pronounced swelling of the subdermis or mucous membranes.
- **A/P:** usually allergic, IgE-mediated or mast cell degranulation. Most common allergens are drugs and foods.
- **R:** positive family history, exposure to food/drug trigger, recent viral infection, recent insect bite/sting.
- **Ix:** bloods (FBC, ESR, CRP, C4 level), others as indicated e.g. skin prick test.
- **Mx:**
  - If anaphylaxis is present (see Anaphylaxis above for the full definition and management, not repeated here): treat as anaphylaxis immediately.
  - Allergen identification and avoidance.
  - Investigate for an underlying disorder.
  - 2nd generation antihistamine.
  - Refer to dermatologist if necessary; advise on reducing scratching.

> [!info] Erythroderma is defined as ≥95% of skin surface involved (a common endpoint of several severe dermatoses, not a diagnosis itself).

## Cutaneous Drug Eruptions (Overview and Spectrum)

> [!note] Gap-filled — drug eruptions were completely absent from this project despite being frequently mentioned as a differential elsewhere (e.g. within [[09_04_Dermatology_-_Eczema__Psoriasis__Rosacea]] Contact Dermatitis (Irritant and Allergic) and the Pruritus differential in [[09_08_Dermatology_-_Miscellaneous]]), and despite SJS/TEN below being one of the most severe forms on this same spectrum. This entry gives the overview and the milder end of the spectrum; SJS/TEN below covers the most severe end in full detail.

**The core principle: drug eruptions span a genuine spectrum from benign and self-limiting to life-threatening**, and recognising which end of the spectrum a given presentation sits on is the most important clinical skill here — not simply recognising "this is a drug rash."

**A careful, complete medication history is the essential first diagnostic step** — prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, supplements, recent contrast administration, and any recent dose changes; **timing from drug initiation to rash onset is genuinely high-yield and differs meaningfully by reaction type**, making it one of the most useful discriminating features:
- **Urticaria/anaphylaxis:** minutes to hours after exposure (see Anaphylaxis and Acute urticaria and angioedema above, not repeated here).
- **Morbilliform (maculopapular) exanthem:** typically 7–14 days after starting a new drug — genuinely the most common drug eruption, accounting for up to ~95% of cutaneous reactions with an identified causative drug.
- **Fixed drug eruption (FDE):** recurs at the **same anatomical site** with each re-exposure to the causative drug — a genuinely distinctive and diagnostic feature; typically appears within 48 hours of re-exposure. Presents as well-demarcated erythematous-to-violaceous patches, sometimes with central blistering, healing with residual post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Common culprits: sulfonamides (including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), NSAIDs, tetracyclines, and other antibiotics. A rare, severe variant — **generalised bullous fixed drug eruption (GBFDE)** — covers a large body surface area and can be life-threatening, clinically resembling SJS/TEN below.
- **DRESS syndrome (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) and SJS/TEN:** both genuinely delayed, typically **2–8 weeks** after drug exposure — a much longer latency than the morbilliform exanthem above, and worth knowing specifically because a patient presenting with a severe reaction weeks after starting a medication may not spontaneously connect the two given how much time has passed.

**Morbilliform (maculopapular) drug exanthem:**
- **S/Smx:** widespread erythematous macules and papules, typically starting on the trunk and spreading, often pruritic; may be accompanied by mild fever.
- **Mx:** supportive — the causative drug should be identified and stopped where possible; oral antihistamines and mild topical corticosteroids/emollients for symptomatic relief; the eruption is generally self-limiting once the drug is stopped. **A genuinely important safety principle: all patients with a morbilliform eruption should be actively monitored for mucous membrane involvement, blistering, or skin sloughing** — the presence of any of these features is what distinguishes a benign morbilliform exanthem from early SJS/TEN or DRESS, and should prompt urgent escalation rather than continued reassurance.

**DRESS syndrome (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms):**
- **D:** a severe, delayed hypersensitivity drug reaction with a genuinely distinct clinical course from a simple exanthem — **fever, facial oedema, a morbilliform/maculopapular rash with scaling, and systemic organ involvement**, occurring 2–8 weeks after starting the causative drug.
- **S/Smx:** the clinical course classically follows a sequence — fever first, then progressive organ involvement (most commonly hepatitis, but also interstitial nephritis, pancreatitis, myocarditis, or pneumonitis depending on the case), followed by the characteristic combination of prominent eosinophilia, lymphadenopathy, atypical circulating leukocytes, and the cutaneous eruption itself. Facial oedema is a genuinely distinctive early clue. **The "oblique earlobe crease sign" has been specifically described as a discriminating feature of DRESS versus other morbilliform eruptions** — a curiosity worth knowing given how few reliable bedside signs exist to separate the causes of a morbilliform rash. Common culprits: anticonvulsants (particularly aromatic ones), allopurinol, sulfonamides, and antibiotics.
- **Mx:** identify and stop the causative drug immediately; admission for supportive care and monitoring of the affected organ systems (given the organ involvement, rather than the skin findings alone, drives most of the morbidity/mortality); systemic corticosteroids are commonly used for significant organ involvement, though this is a specialist-guided decision given the evidence base is less robust than for some other severe drug reactions.
- **P:** a genuinely serious condition — DRESS carries meaningful mortality (largely driven by the organ involvement, particularly fulminant hepatitis), and recovery can be prolonged with a risk of relapse even after the causative drug is stopped, given the reaction can continue evolving for some time.

**Other drug eruption patterns worth knowing exist** (not detailed further here, given lower individual yield): acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP — widespread sterile pustules, typically rapid onset within days of the causative drug, most commonly antibiotics); photosensitivity reactions and drug-induced pigmentary changes; drug-induced lichenoid and vasculitic eruptions.

## Stevens-Johnson syndrome / Toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN)

- **D:** SJS is a severe skin detachment disorder with mucocutaneous complications.

> [!info] Classification by total body surface area (TBSA) involvement
> - SJS: <10% TBSA
> - SJS/TEN overlap: 10–30% TBSA
> - TEN: >30% TBSA

- **R:** active cancer, drugs (anticonvulsants, antibiotics, etc), recent infection, SLE, HIV, radiotherapy, HLA and genetic predisposition, smallpox vaccination.
- **A/P:** detachment of the epidermis from the papillary dermis at the epidermal-dermal junction, manifesting as a papulomacular rash and bullae as a result of keratinocyte apoptosis.

> [!info] Gap-filled — "HLA and genetic predisposition" was stated without any specifics, despite this being a genuinely testable and clinically actionable point. **The immunological mechanism**: SJS/TEN is a **type IV (delayed) hypersensitivity reaction** — the causative drug (or its metabolite) binds to a specific **HLA (human leukocyte antigen)** class I molecule on antigen-presenting cells, and this drug-HLA complex is recognised by cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells as foreign, triggering a cytotoxic immune response against keratinocytes (via Fas-FasL interaction and granulysin release) — this is the actual process underlying the "keratinocyte apoptosis" already noted above, not a separate mechanism.
> **A specific, genuinely important drug-HLA pairing: allopurinol and HLA-B*58:01.** Allopurinol is one of the most frequently implicated drugs in SJS/TEN overall (in some case series, the single most commonly identified causative drug), and this risk is strongly concentrated in patients carrying HLA-B*58:01 — an allele with meaningfully higher frequency in some Asian populations (particularly Han Chinese and Thai) than in the general Australian population, though it isn't absent in other backgrounds. This is genuinely relevant given allopurinol's role as first-line urate-lowering therapy for gout already established elsewhere in this project (see [[12_02_Rheum_-_Ankylosing_Spondylitis__Gout__Pseudogout__Reactive_Arthritis__Fibromyalgia__PMR__CFS]] Gout, not repeated here) — there is genuine, current Australian clinical discussion (RACGP) about the case for limited/targeted HLA-B*58:01 screening before starting allopurinol in patients from higher-risk ethnic backgrounds, rather than universal screening for every patient starting the drug — check current local guidance given this remains an evolving area of practice.

- **S/Smx:**
  - Rash — maculopapular (widespread) + target lesions; may develop into vesicles or bullae.
  - Nikolsky's sign — blisters and erosions appear when skin is rubbed gently.
  - Mucosal involvement.
  - Systemic symptoms: fever, arthralgia.
- **Ix:** skin biopsy is key to diagnosis; blood cultures to rule out toxic shock and scalded skin syndromes; FBC, blood glucose, U&Es (incl Mg, PO4, bicarb), ESR, CRP, LFT; ABG; CXR; coagulation studies (rule out DIC); skin swab for secondary infection.
- **Mx:** admit ± burns unit/ICU. Find and remove the causative agent. Supportive care + careful wound care (treat as a 2nd degree burn). Fluid management, pain management.
- **P:** worse if >50 years old, high TBSA, not managed in a burns centre, sepsis + antibiotic use, pulmonary issues. Higher mortality in children also.

## Eczema herpeticum

> [!note] See [[08_05-06_Infectious_Disease_-_Viral_Infections]] Herpes simplex virus (HSV) for the general oral/genital HSV entry, not repeated here — this is a clinically distinct presentation (disseminated HSV superimposed on pre-existing eczema, a genuine dermatological emergency), not a variant of the general entry.

- **D:** disseminated HSV-1 or HSV-2 infection characterised by fever and clusters of itchy blisters or punched-out erosions.
- **A/P:** HSV-1/2 infection superimposed on a pre-existing skin condition, most commonly in infants and children with atopic dermatitis (due to impaired skin immunity).
- **S/Smx:**
  - Clusters of itchy and painful blisters, most commonly on face/neck.
  - New patches form and spread over 7–10 days, rarely widely disseminated.
  - Associated with fever, swollen lymph nodes, malaise.
  - Blisters are monomorphic ± filled with clear yellow fluid or thick purulent material ± blood stained.
  - Blisters may weep or bleed, then crust and form sores; may leave long-term scars.
- **Ix:** swab — serology, PCR or MC&S; ± skin biopsy.
- **Mx:** aciclovir PO 400–800mg 5×/day for 10–14 days or until lesions heal. If patient is severely unwell, IV aciclovir. Secondary bacterial infection — antibiotics. Topical steroids are not recommended. Refer to ophthalmologist if ocular involvement.

## Staph scalded skin syndrome (SSSS)

- **D:** severe, superficial blistering skin disorder characterised by detachment of the epidermis due to exotoxin release from *Staph aureus*.
- **R:** <5 years old (peak 2–3 years), reduced immunity.
- **A/P:** toxigenic *S. aureus* produces exfoliative toxins A and B which bind to desmosomes in the epidermis → desmoglein-1 is broken down → epidermis detaches → blistering.

> [!tip] Desmoglein-1 is NOT present in mucosa, so mucosa is spared in SSSS — this helps distinguish it from SJS/TEN and pemphigus, both of which do involve mucosa.

- **S/Smx:**
  - Usually starts with non-specific symptoms in children — fever, generally unwell.
  - Red rash with wrinkled, tissue- or paper-like consistency.
  - Formation of large fluid-filled blisters (can be cloudy or contain pus).
  - Blisters rupture easily → skin peels off in large sheets → "burned" appearance.
  - Nikolsky's sign positive.
- **Ix:** clinical diagnosis. Skin and wound swabs (MC&S). Blood cultures if sepsis. Skin biopsy if concerned about other diagnoses.
- **Mx:** admit. IV antibiotics e.g. flucloxacillin, ceftriaxone. Supportive: IV fluids, pain relief, skin care (gentle washing with soap substitute, apply emollients, burn dressings if needed).
- **Complications:** scarring, hypothermia, hypovolaemia/electrolyte abnormalities, secondary infections (sepsis, cellulitis, pneumonia), renal failure.
- **P:** if treated promptly, should resolve within 2 weeks.

## Necrotising fasciitis

> [!note] Full entry consolidated into [[08_09_Infectious_Disease_-_Miscellaneous]] Necrotising fasciitis, not duplicated here — that entry now incorporates the classification, red-flag features, finger test, and Ix/Mx detail from both this file's original content and the Infectious Disease file's, merged into a single authoritative version. Cross-referenced here as this is also a dermatological emergency in its own right, but kept as a single-source entry to avoid drift between two independently-maintained copies of the same disease.

## Cutaneous vasculitis

- **D:** cutaneous manifestation of vasculitic disorders — inflammation of blood vessels within the skin, ranging from a purely skin-limited process to the cutaneous manifestation of a systemic vasculitis.
- **A/P:** immune complex deposition in small dermal vessels (leukocytoclastic vasculitis is the most common histological pattern) → vessel wall inflammation and damage → extravasation of red cells into the skin (purpura) and, in more severe cases, tissue ischaemia/necrosis. Causes span infection (post-streptococcal, hepatitis B/C), drugs (a common and important cause — antibiotics, NSAIDs, allopurinol among others), malignancy (paraneoplastic), and primary systemic vasculitides (e.g. IgA vasculitis/Henoch-Schönlein purpura, ANCA-associated vasculitis, cryoglobulinaemia) — roughly half of cases remain idiopathic despite investigation.
- **S/Smx:** purpura (± palpable — palpability is a classically taught distinguishing feature of vasculitic purpura from other causes of purpura like thrombocytopenia, since it reflects the inflammatory infiltrate within the vessel wall rather than purely extravasated blood), typically on dependent areas (lower limbs); may progress to vesicles, haemorrhagic bullae, or ulceration in more severe cases. **Systemic features and their pattern are the key differentiator between skin-limited and systemic disease** — fever, arthralgia, abdominal pain, haematuria/renal impairment, or peripheral neuropathy should prompt urgent work-up for an underlying systemic vasculitis rather than assuming a purely cutaneous process.
- **Ix:** skin biopsy with direct immunofluorescence (*why:* confirms the vasculitic diagnosis histologically and can identify the specific immune complex deposited (e.g. IgA deposition supports IgA vasculitis/HSP), directly informing which systemic work-up to pursue; *what:* leukocytic infiltration and fibrinoid necrosis of vessel walls on histology, with the specific immunofluorescence pattern narrowing the differential). Urinalysis (*why:* screens for renal involvement — a critical test given renal vasculitis can be asymptomatic early and carries significant long-term morbidity if missed, particularly relevant given IgA vasculitis/HSP's known renal association; *what:* haematuria or proteinuria would indicate renal involvement requiring nephrology input). Bloods — FBC, U&Es, LFTs, ESR/CRP, ANCA, complement levels, hepatitis B/C serology, cryoglobulins (*why:* screens for the underlying systemic cause/association per the aetiology list above, directly guiding whether this is skin-limited or the cutaneous manifestation of a systemic disease needing its own specific management; *what:* positive ANCA supports ANCA-associated vasculitis, low complement supports immune-complex-mediated disease, positive cryoglobulins support cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis). Medication review (*why:* drug-induced vasculitis is common and the single most actionable step — stopping the causative drug can be curative; *what:* identifies a temporally-associated new medication as the likely trigger).
- **Mx:**
  - **Immediate/acute:** identify and stop any causative drug where relevant, given this is often the single most effective intervention; treat any identified underlying infection.
  - **Definitive:** for skin-limited disease — supportive care (rest, leg elevation, compression), NSAIDs for symptomatic relief; for more severe or systemic disease — corticosteroids ± steroid-sparing immunosuppressants (DMARDs, e.g. azathioprine, methotrexate, or specific agents depending on the underlying systemic vasculitis identified).
  - **Chronic/long-term:** treatment of the underlying systemic disease if identified (e.g. specific ANCA-associated vasculitis management), with the specific approach and duration depending on that diagnosis rather than the cutaneous manifestation alone; ongoing monitoring for renal involvement given its potential for delayed/insidious onset.

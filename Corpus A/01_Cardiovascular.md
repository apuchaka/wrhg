## 0.1 Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)

**D:** Spectrum of acute myocardial ischaemia or infarction.

| Type | ECG | Troponin |
|---|---|---|
| STEMI | ST elevation | Positive |
| NSTEMI | Inconclusive (normal or other change) | Positive |
| Unstable angina | Normal | Normal |

**R:**
- Unmodifiable: increasing age, male, family history
- Modifiable: smoking, DM, HTN, hypercholesterolaemia, obesity

**A/P:** Atherosclerosis in coronary vessels secondary to endothelial dysfunction (smoking, HTN, hyperglycaemia) → plaque formation → physical blockage → reduced blood flow to myocardium → ischaemia/angina. Plaque rupture may cause complete occlusion → myocardial infarction.

**S/Smx:** Angina at rest (>20 min), not relieved by GTN. Gripping/heavy pain, associated with nausea, sweating, dyspnoea, palpitations.

> [!info] STEMI ECG criteria
> ≥20 min symptoms, ECG features in ≥2 contiguous leads:
> - 2.5 mm ST elevation in V2–3 in men ≤40yo, or ≥2.0 mm in men >40yo
> - 1.5 mm ST elevation in V2–3 in women
> - 1 mm ST elevation in other leads
> - New LBBB (always considered pathological)

**Ix:** ECG (*why:* first-line, identifies STEMI/ischaemic changes within minutes and localises the territory; *what:* ST elevation/depression, T wave changes, new LBBB — see criteria and territories below). Troponin (*why:* confirms myocyte necrosis and distinguishes NSTEMI/STEMI from unstable angina; *what:* elevated in MI, normal in unstable angina — see table above). FBC (*why:* screens for anaemia as a contributor to demand ischaemia, and infection/inflammation; *what:* may be normal or show anaemia). Lipids, HbA1c (*why:* establishes cardiovascular risk factor burden for secondary prevention; *what:* often deranged, guides statin/diabetes management). U&E (*why:* baseline renal function before contrast/ACEI and to guide fluid/drug dosing; *what:* usually normal, deranged in CKD). LFT (*why:* baseline before statin therapy; *what:* usually normal). TFT (*why:* screens for thyrotoxicosis as a precipitant of demand ischaemia/arrhythmia; *what:* usually normal). ABG (*why:* assesses oxygenation and lactate if haemodynamically compromised; *what:* may show hypoxia or metabolic acidosis in cardiogenic shock). CXR (*why:* screens for pulmonary oedema/complications and alternative diagnoses e.g. widened mediastinum in dissection; *what:* may show pulmonary oedema, cardiomegaly, or be normal). Echo (*why:* assesses regional wall motion, LV function, and mechanical complications; *what:* regional wall motion abnormality in the infarct territory, reduced EF). Blood glucose (*why:* hyperglycaemia is common in acute MI and worsens outcomes; *what:* often elevated even in non-diabetics acutely).

### 0.1.1 ECG cardiac territories
| Leads | Territory | Vessel |
|---|---|---|
| V1–6, aVL | Proximal | LAD |
| I, aVL, V5–6 | Lateral | LCx |
| II, III, aVF | Inferior | RCA |
| V1–3 (anterior/septal) | Anteroseptal | LAD |

> [!note] Posterior STEMI
> Reciprocal V1–3 changes: ST depression, tall/broad R waves, upright T waves. Confirmed by ST elevation and Q waves in posterior leads (V7–9). Inferior MIs are associated with AV block.
### Added from unverified layer — right ventricular infarction and the right-sided leads
`SRC:B1_Chest_Pain_Framework_and_Cardiac_Biomarkers §0.1` `UNVERIFIED — model knowledge, not source-checked.`

> [!danger] Inferior STEMI — obtain right-sided leads (V4R) before giving GTN
> The territory table above sends an inferior pattern (II, III, aVF) to the RCA, which also
> supplies the right ventricle. **Right ventricular infarction is preload-dependent:** the
> failing RV cannot fill against a reduced venous return, so **a vasodilator causes profound
> hypotension.** These patients need **fluid rather than vasodilatation**.
> The contraindication itself is already stated at
> [[NEW_Drugs_06_Cardiovascular]] *"Nitrates are contraindicated (or dangerous) in:
> right ventricular / inferior myocardial infarction — a preload-dependent ventricle"*. What
> that entry does not give is **how you know**, which is this: **right-sided chest leads,
> V4R in particular, in any inferior STEMI.** §0.1.2 above says "GTN 1 spray (caution
> hypotension)" — this is the specific reason for that caution.


**DDx of ST changes:**
- Global T wave inversion → think non-cardiac cause
- Pericarditis → global ST elevation
- PE → sinus tachycardia (most common), S1Q3T3

### 0.1.2 Mx – Immediate (all patients)
Aspirin 300 mg, O2 if sats <94%, paracetamol 1 g PO/IV (morphine only if severe pain), GTN 1 spray (caution hypotension), ± ondansetron 4 mg IV

### 0.1.3 Mx – Definitive (STEMI)

> [!tip] Decision: <12h of symptoms AND is PCI possible within 2h?

**PCI possible within 2h:**
- Prasugrel (clopidogrel if on oral anticoagulant; ticagrelor if high bleeding risk)
- Obtain radial access (preferred to femoral)
- UFH + bailout GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor
- PCI with drug-eluting stent

**Fibrinolysis (if PCI not possible within 2h):**
- Alteplase etc + antithrombin
- Thereafter, ticagrelor
- If no ECG resolution after 60–90 min → PCI

> [!warning] Presenting >12h with ongoing STEMI symptoms or cardiogenic shock — still consider PCI referral.

### 0.1.4 Mx – Definitive (NSTEMI)
Risk stratify with **GRACE score** (predicts all-cause mortality at 6 months post-discharge for ACS).

- **Low risk (≤3% 6-month mortality):** fondaparinux + ticagrelor
- **Intermediate/high risk (>3%):**
  - Unstable → PCI immediately (as per STEMI PCI pathway)
  - Stable → PCI within 72h + fondaparinux, prasugrel or ticagrelor, and UFH

### 0.1.5 Mx – Chronic/long-term: unstable angina & secondary prevention (lifelong)
> [!tip] Mnemonic "6 A's"
> Aspirin 75 mg OD, Another antiplatelet for 12mo (e.g. clopidogrel), Atorvastatin 80 mg OD, ACEI (e.g. ramipril), Atenolol (or bisoprolol), Aldosterone antagonist for HF (e.g. eplerenone)

> [!warning] Verified against the Australian Heart Foundation ACS Guideline, Aug 2026 — two separate issues here, one about drug choice and one more substantive about the underlying indication itself.
> **Drug choice:** "Atenolol" in the mnemonic appears chosen to fit the "A" letter pattern rather than reflecting best evidence — bisoprolol, carvedilol, or metoprolol (controlled/extended release) are the beta-blockers the Australian Heart Foundation guideline specifically names as having proven benefit, not atenolol.
> **More substantively — the indication itself is narrower than the mnemonic implies:** the Heart Foundation guideline specifically ties the beta-blocker recommendation to **confirmed LV dysfunction**, not to post-MI status alone — "In people with preserved ejection fraction, no benefit in continuing beta blockers beyond 12 months has been seen." This reflects a genuinely live area of cardiology debate: contemporary evidence (e.g. the REDUCE-AMI trial, and ongoing 2025–2026 discussion in major journals) increasingly questions routine indefinite beta-blocker use after MI in patients with preserved LV function, given how much modern revascularisation and other GDMT has changed outcomes since the original evidence base for this practice was established. Don't teach "beta-blocker is a standard lifelong post-MI drug for everyone" as a flat rule — the strength of the indication depends on LV function, and even then the long-term (>12 month) benefit in preserved-EF patients is now genuinely uncertain rather than an settled given.

### 0.1.6 Complications
> [!danger] "DREAD": Death, Rupture of myocardium, Edema, Arrhythmia and aneurysms, Dressler's syndrome

### 0.1.7 Post-MI risk stratification — Killip class
| Class | Findings | 30-day mortality |
|---|---|---|
| I | No clinical signs of HF | 6% |
| II | Lung crackles + S3 | 17% |
| III | Frank pulmonary oedema | 38% |
| IV | Cardiogenic shock | 81% |

**P:** ~10% morbidity; increased risk of future events.

### 0.1.8 Other notes
- MI associated with cocaine use: add IV benzodiazepine; consider avoiding β-blockers
- Diet: Mediterranean-style; no evidence for omega-3/fish supplementation
- Exercise: 20–30 min daily
- Sex: resume after 4 weeks
- PDE-5 inhibitors (sildenafil) can be used 6 months after MI; avoid with nitrates and nicorandil

### 0.1.9 Explaining a new MI/ACS diagnosis to a patient

> [!note] Targeted patient-facing addition — ACS/post-MI counselling is a plausible OSCE "explain/counsel" station. See [[Communication]] for the general communication-station framework this sits within.

- Plain-language explanation: "One of the arteries supplying blood to your heart muscle became blocked, which starved part of your heart of oxygen." Avoid unexplained jargon ("infarct," "occlusion") unless you then define it.
- Address the emotional impact directly — an MI is frightening and often reframes a patient's sense of their own mortality; name this ("This is a lot to take in — a heart attack understandably makes people worried about what comes next").
- Explain the immediate treatment received (angioplasty/stent or clot-busting medication) in simple terms and what it achieved.
- Explain secondary prevention medications as a group and why they matter long-term (the "6 A's," section 0.1.5) rather than listing them as an overwhelming pill count — frame as "these medications work together to stop this happening again."
- Cover the practical/lifestyle points from 0.1.8 above (diet, exercise, sex, driving — cross-reference [[01_Cardiovascular]] 0.34.5 for Austroads timing) as part of this same conversation, since patients usually want to know "when can I get back to normal life."
- Check understanding and invite questions before closing; offer written information and cardiac rehabilitation referral.

## 0.2 Hypertension

**D:** Persistently raised blood pressure.

**R:** obesity, metabolic syndrome, reduced exercise, increased alcohol, DM, black ancestry, >60yo, family history (HTN, CKD), sleep apnoea

**Aetiology:**
- Essential HTN — no specific cause
- Secondary HTN:
  - Primary hyperaldosteronism
  - Renal disease (glomerulonephritis, renal artery stenosis)
  - Endocrine (Cushing's, phaeochromocytoma, acromegaly)
  - Drugs (steroids, COCP)
  - Others: pregnancy, coarctation of the aorta

#### Added from unverified layer — three things the aetiology list above does not say
`SRC:B2_Hypertension_Spectrum §0.4` `UNVERIFIED — model knowledge, not source-checked.`

> [!tip] Renovascular hypertension has **two** causes with different patients
> The list above says "renal artery stenosis" without splitting it. It is **atherosclerotic**
> in older patients with vascular disease elsewhere, and **fibromuscular dysplasia** in
> **younger women**, classically with a **"string of beads"** appearance on angiography.
> `fibromuscular` and `string of beads` were both **absent from the whole vault** before this.
> Suspect either with an **abdominal bruit**.

> [!danger] A significant creatinine rise after starting an ACE inhibitor or ARB suggests **bilateral** renal artery stenosis
> In bilateral disease, glomerular filtration depends on angiotensin II-mediated efferent
> arteriolar constriction. Removing it drops filtration on both sides at once. **A rise in
> creatinine after starting an ACEi or ARB is therefore a diagnostic signal, not only an
> adverse effect** — and it is one of the few ways renovascular hypertension announces itself
> without imaging.

> [!warning] Drugs the list above omits
> Alongside steroids and the COCP: **venlafaxine and other SNRIs**, **ciclosporin**,
> **erythropoietin**, NSAIDs, decongestants and stimulants. `liquorice` is already covered at
> [[NEW_Cardiology_and_Vascular]] §Elevated Blood Pressure, where it is noted as an apparent
> mineralocorticoid excess.

### 0.2.1 Staging
| Stage | Clinic BP | ABPM |
|---|---|---|
| Stage 1 | ≥140/90 | ≥135/85 |
| Stage 2 | ≥160/100 | ≥150/95 |
| Stage 3 (crisis) | ≥180/120 | — |

**MAP** = DBP + ⅓(SBP − DBP)

### 0.2.2 Diagnosing hypertension
- If clinic BP ≥140/90: remeasure after 5 min, on both arms, check cuff placement
- Confirm with ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) to exclude white coat syndrome
- Alternative: home BP monitoring — 2 readings morning + 2 evening, for 4–7 days

#### Added from unverified layer — masked hypertension, and which arm to use
`SRC:B2_Hypertension_Spectrum §0.1` `UNVERIFIED — model knowledge, not source-checked.`

> [!danger] ABPM excludes white coat hypertension. It also finds **masked** hypertension, which is the dangerous one
> The line above uses out-of-office monitoring to rule *out* a false positive. It equally
> rules *in* a false negative:
> - **White coat** — raised in clinic, normal outside. Not entirely benign, but does not warrant the same treatment.
> - **Masked** — **normal in clinic, raised outside.** It carries the cardiovascular risk of hypertension and, because every clinic reading is reassuring, **it goes untreated.**
>
> **Out-of-office thresholds are lower than clinic thresholds** — see the ABPM column in §0.2.1. Reading home numbers against clinic numbers over-diagnoses.

> [!tip] If the two arms differ persistently, use the higher one from then on
> "Remeasure on both arms" above finds an **inter-arm difference**, which itself suggests
> **subclavian stenosis, coarctation or aortic dissection** and is worth pursuing. Once a
> persistent difference is established, **the arm with the higher reading is the one used
> for all subsequent measurement** — otherwise every later reading understates the pressure.

**Ix:** Fundoscopy (*why:* screens for hypertensive retinopathy as a marker of target-organ damage/chronicity; *what:* graded I–IV, see below). Urine dipstick/ACR (*why:* screens for renal target-organ damage and as a clue to secondary causes e.g. glomerulonephritis; *what:* proteinuria/haematuria if renal involvement). ECG (*why:* screens for LVH as target-organ damage and for arrhythmia; *what:* voltage criteria for LVH, strain pattern). Bloods — FBC (*why:* baseline, screens for polycythaemia in some secondary causes; *what:* usually normal), U&Es (*why:* baseline renal function and screens for renal-cause/renal-damage, plus baseline before ACEI/diuretic; *what:* may show renal impairment or hypokalaemia suggesting hyperaldosteronism), HbA1c (*why:* screens for coexisting diabetes, common comorbidity affecting risk stratification; *what:* may be elevated), lipids (*why:* completes the cardiovascular risk profile for absolute-risk-based treatment decisions; *what:* often deranged, part of risk calculation).

> [!info] Hypertensive retinopathy grading
> - Grade I: barely detectable arterial narrowing
> - Grade II: obvious narrowing + focal irregularities
> - Grade III: flame haemorrhages, dot/blot haemorrhages, hard/soft exudates, cotton wool spots
> - Grade IV: papilloedema

### 0.2.3 Treatment threshold

**Mx – Immediate/acute (hypertensive emergency, i.e. Stage 3/crisis BP with acute target-organ damage — encephalopathy, ACS, aortic dissection, acute pulmonary oedema, AKI, eclampsia):** IV antihypertensives (e.g. GTN infusion, labetalol, or sodium nitroprusside depending on context) in a monitored setting; controlled BP reduction (generally aiming for a gradual reduction over hours, not immediate normalisation, to avoid hypoperfusion — the specific target/rate depends on the precipitating emergency, e.g. faster reduction is appropriate in dissection than in most other hypertensive emergencies). Note: asymptomatic severe hypertension without acute target-organ damage ("hypertensive urgency") does **not** require emergency IV treatment — manage with oral therapy and outpatient follow-up.
#### Added from unverified layer — why gradual, and the nitroprusside caveat
`SRC:B2_Hypertension_Spectrum §0.2, §0.3` `UNVERIFIED — model knowledge, not source-checked. Percentage reduction targets and the permitted duration of a nitroprusside infusion, per eTG Cardiovascular.`

> [!danger] The reason "gradual, not immediate normalisation" is a rule and not a preference
> **Chronic hypertension shifts the cerebral autoregulation curve to the right.** The brain
> has adapted to perfusing at a higher pressure, and **its lower autoregulatory limit has
> risen with it.** Dropping the pressure abruptly to a population-"normal" value therefore
> takes it **below that shifted limit**, and the result is cerebral hypoperfusion — the
> injury the treatment was given to prevent.
> This is why **treating the number rather than the patient** is among the most common
> avoidable harms in this area, and why the line above prefers a **titratable** agent in a
> monitored setting: an overshoot must be correctable within minutes.

> [!warning] Sodium nitroprusside is not a drug to leave running
> **Sodium nitroprusside is metabolised to thiocyanate and cyanide, which accumulate** with
> prolonged infusion or in **renal impairment**. That limits how long it can be used and
> mandates monitoring — a consideration the agent list above does not carry, and one that
> matters most in exactly the patient a hypertensive emergency produces, whose kidneys are
> often already injured.


**Mx – Definitive/chronic (routine hypertension, not a crisis):**
Treat if <80yo AND (target organ damage OR established CVD/AKI/CKD/T2DM OR 10-year cardiovascular risk ≥10%).

> [!info] Verified against AMH/Heart Foundation, Aug 2026 — Australian approach differs from the UK NICE stepwise regimen (which this file no longer carries); do not use race-based stratification (not part of Australian guidance).
> Australian treatment decisions are driven by **absolute cardiovascular disease risk** (the 2023 Australian Guideline for assessing and managing CVD risk, using the AusCVD Risk Calculator — a recalibrated NZ PREDICT-based equation), rather than blood pressure alone or the UK's age/ethnicity-stratified drug-class algorithm.
> - Lifestyle modification for all patients.
> - Drug therapy: recent PBS restriction changes now support starting most patients on a **dual single-pill combination** (a RAS blocker [ACEI or ARB] + either a CCB or a thiazide-like diuretic) as initial therapy, rather than the older stepwise monotherapy-first approach — this reflects a broader shift also seen in ESH/international guidelines.
> - If BP remains uncontrolled: triple therapy (RAS blocker + CCB + thiazide-like diuretic); further steps as per specialist guidance (e.g. spironolactone for resistant hypertension).
> - No routine ACEI/ARB-vs-CCB first-choice split by age or ethnicity — ethnicity-based prescribing algorithms (as in NICE) are not part of Australian practice.
>
> [!warning] A dedicated **2026 Australian Hypertension Guideline** (Heart Foundation/Stroke Foundation/Hypertension Australia, National Hypertension Taskforce) is in final review and expected to be published later in 2026 (as of Aug 2026, not yet released) — it will likely supersede the above once out. Check the Heart Foundation website for the published version closer to the exam.

**Other notes on Mx:**
- DM: ACEI/ARB best
- CKD: ACEI/ARB first line; furosemide useful if GFR <45 — monitor for dehydration
- Isolated systolic hypertension: treat as normal HTN

### 0.2.4 Antihypertensives — side effects
> [!info] Verified against AMH, Aug 2026 — adverse-effect profiles are pharmacological and not jurisdiction-specific; no change needed. (Specific dosing/monitoring schedules are addressed separately in section 0.34 below, which still needs full AMH dose verification.)

**ACE-inhibitors:**
- Dry cough (15%, usually in 1st year), angioedema, hyperkalaemia, first-dose hypotension
- If dry cough develops, switch to ARB
- Avoid in pregnancy and breastfeeding
- Caution/CI in renovascular disease (e.g. bilateral renal artery stenosis), aortic stenosis, hereditary idiopathic angioedema
- May cause increased creatinine (up to 30% acceptable)

**CCBs:**
- Verapamil: constipation, hypotension, bradycardia, flushing; caution in HF
- Diltiazem: hypotension, ↓HR, ankle swelling; caution in HF

> [!danger] Do NOT give verapamil or diltiazem with a β-blocker — may cause heart block.

- Amlodipine, nifedipine etc: flushing, headache, ankle swelling, reflex tachycardia; no issue with HF

**Thiazide-like diuretics:** hypoK, hypoNa, hyperCa, gout, impaired glucose tolerance, impotence; rarely pancreatitis, ↓platelets, agranulocytosis, photosensitivity rash

### 0.2.5 Explaining a new hypertension diagnosis to a patient

> [!note] Targeted patient-facing addition — a very plausible OSCE "explain a new diagnosis" station given how common HTN is. See [[Communication]] for the general framework.

- Plain-language explanation: "Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against your artery walls — yours is consistently higher than it should be, which puts extra strain on your heart and blood vessels over time."
- Correct the common misconception that HTN causes symptoms — most patients feel entirely well, which can make the diagnosis feel abstract or make them doubt it. Explain it's often called a "silent" condition precisely because of this, which is why it needs picking up on screening rather than waiting for symptoms.
- Explain what untreated HTN risks (stroke, heart attack, kidney damage) without being alarmist — frame the diagnosis as something very manageable with early action, not a dire prognosis.
- Discuss the absolute-risk-based approach used in Australia (section 0.2.3) in accessible terms: "we look at your overall risk profile, not just the blood pressure number in isolation."
- Cover lifestyle measures and medication together as a joint plan, checking the patient's own readiness/barriers to lifestyle change rather than just prescribing advice.
- Set expectations about monitoring (repeat BP checks, possible home monitoring) and that medication choice/dose may need adjusting over subsequent visits — this isn't usually a "one and done" conversation.
- Check understanding and invite questions before closing.

## 0.3 Ischaemic Heart Disease

**D:** Inadequate blood supply to the myocardium. Angina = chest pain from reduced myocardial blood flow.

**R:** age, smoking, CAD, HTN, ↑cholesterol, DM, IVDU, male, sedentary lifestyle

**A/P:** Atherosclerosis secondary to endothelial dysfunction (smoking, HTN, hyperglycaemia) → plaque formation → reduced blood flow → ischaemia/angina.

**S/Smx:**
- Stable angina (all 3 features): chest pressure/constriction <20 min, provoked by exertion, relieved by rest or GTN
- Atypical angina (women, DM, older people): 2 of 3 above + GI discomfort, dyspnoea, nausea
- Neither pattern: **non-anginal** chest pain. `SRC:B1_Chest_Pain_Framework_and_Cardiac_Biomarkers §0.2` `UNVERIFIED — model knowledge, not source-checked.`
- **Severity is graded by the level of exertion that provokes it** (Canadian Cardiovascular Society class) — the axis is functional limitation, not pain intensity. `SRC:B1_Chest_Pain_Framework_and_Cardiac_Biomarkers §0.2` `UNVERIFIED — the CCS class descriptors themselves, per Heart Foundation or CSANZ. Not reproduced here.`
### Added from unverified layer — response to treatment is not a diagnostic test
`SRC:B1_Chest_Pain_Framework_and_Cardiac_Biomarkers §0.1` `UNVERIFIED — model knowledge, not source-checked.`

> [!warning] The triad above uses GTN relief as a **feature**, not as a rule-out
> Relief with GTN **does not confirm** that pain is cardiac — **GTN relieves oesophageal
> spasm**, which is one of the differentials it is being used to exclude. Relief with an
> **antacid does not exclude** cardiac pain either. **Do not use response to treatment as a
> diagnostic test in chest pain.**
> This qualifies rather than contradicts the triad: "relieved by rest or GTN" is one of
> three features of typical angina and stays correct as written. What it cannot do is stand
> alone, and it is used as a discriminator in three further places —
> [[History-Taking]] (in SOCRATES), §0.1 S/Smx, and §0.32 Pericarditis
> ("may mimic MI but not relieved by GTN").

### Added from unverified layer — accelerated diagnostic protocols
`SRC:B1_Chest_Pain_Framework_and_Cardiac_Biomarkers §0.1` `UNVERIFIED — which pathway your site uses, and its components and thresholds, per your health network's chest pain pathway.`

> [!tip] Australian emergency departments risk-stratify chest pain with a **structured
> accelerated diagnostic protocol**, not with gestalt
> These pathways combine history, ECG, risk factors and serial troponin to identify patients
> low-risk enough for early discharge. **Applying one is more defensible than an impression**,
> and which one is in use is a local question.
> **Components, point allocations and cut-offs are deliberately not stated here** — they are
> site- and assay-specific, and a remembered threshold applied to the wrong assay is worse
> than no threshold. Look them up on your own network's pathway at the point of use.


**Ix:** ECG (*why:* screens for ischaemic changes/prior infarction and baseline before starting anti-anginal drugs; *what:* usually normal between episodes; may show ST depression during pain, or Q waves if prior MI). Bloods — Hb (*why:* screens for anaemia as a reversible contributor to demand ischaemia; *what:* may be low), lipids/HbA1c (*why:* completes cardiovascular risk assessment; *what:* often deranged). If stable angina cannot be excluded clinically: CT coronary angiography (*why:* first-line non-invasive anatomical test per current stepped-diagnostic pathway; *what:* visualises coronary stenosis directly) → non-invasive functional imaging e.g. stress echo/perfusion scan (*why:* used if CT is inconclusive or contraindicated, assesses functional significance of a stenosis; *what:* reversible perfusion defect/wall motion abnormality on stress) → invasive coronary angiography (*why:* 3rd line, gold-standard when non-invasive tests are inconclusive or high-risk features are present, and allows immediate PCI; *what:* directly visualises and can quantify stenosis severity).

**Mx – Immediate/acute (symptomatic relief during an episode):**
- Sublingual GTN for symptom relief (or pre-emptively before triggering activity): 1 dose + rest → if no relief, 2nd dose → if still no relief, call emergency services (treat as possible ACS)

**Mx – Definitive/chronic (secondary prevention + symptom control):**
- Aspirin 75 mg OD (unless already on an antiplatelet)
- Statin (e.g. atorvastatin)
- β-blocker and/or CCB — do not give β-blocker to asthmatics; if CCB monotherapy, use verapamil/diltiazem; if combined with β-blocker, use amlodipine/nifedipine
- Long-acting nitrate (e.g. isosorbide mononitrate), nicorandil, ivabradine, or ranolazine
- In DM patients, consider ACE inhibitor
- Lifestyle: smoking cessation, limit alcohol, cardioprotective diet, weight loss and exercise
- Consider revascularisation (PCI/CABG) if symptoms persist despite optimal medical therapy, or high-risk anatomy on angiography

> [!info] Verified against Austroads *Assessing Fitness to Drive* 2022, Aug 2026 — same underlying principle as the UK DVLA rule, restated in Austroads' own private-vehicle terms (see full driving standards table in section 0.34.5 below).
> A person with angina that is usually absent on mild exertion, and who is treatment-compliant, may drive without restriction and without notifying the driver licensing authority. A person is not fit to hold an unconditional licence if angina occurs at rest or on minimal exertion despite treatment, or if unstable.

### Added from unverified layer — coronary vasospasm (Prinzmetal / variant angina)
`SRC:B1_Chest_Pain_Framework_and_Cardiac_Biomarkers §0.4` `UNVERIFIED — model knowledge, not source-checked. Agents and doses per eTG Cardiovascular; the entity is already queued at PENDING_GUIDELINE_CHECKS P5-A30 against eTG and Heart Foundation.`

**D:** Transient intense spasm of an epicardial coronary artery causing myocardial ischaemia. Historically Prinzmetal or variant angina. Named once elsewhere in this file, in the ST-elevation causes list at §0.12, and not otherwise described.

**A/P:** Hyperreactivity of coronary vascular smooth muscle with endothelial dysfunction and autonomic influence → abrupt focal or diffuse spasm → **transient total or subtotal occlusion in an artery that may be angiographically normal** → transient ST elevation that resolves completely as the spasm relieves. **Because the mechanism is smooth muscle constriction rather than thrombus, the treatment is vasodilatation rather than antithrombotic therapy** — which inverts the §0.1 approach.

> [!tip] The recognisable pattern — it is the mirror image of §0.3
> **Pain at rest, characteristically at night or in the early hours**, in a patient with **preserved exercise tolerance**. Fixed obstructive disease does the opposite: pain on exertion, relief at rest. **Transient ST elevation during pain that resolves entirely**, often with arrhythmia. Typically younger patients, **smoking the dominant modifiable risk factor**, and more frequent in women than fixed atherosclerotic disease.

> [!warning] Triggers worth asking about
> **Smoking** · **cocaine and amphetamines** — the critical history in any young person with chest pain, see §0.1 and [[14a-1_Psych_-_Substance_Misuse__Recreational_Drug_Profiles_]] · triptans · **fluorouracil and capecitabine**, a recognised chemotherapy-induced coronary vasospasm presenting during infusion · cold exposure · hyperventilation · alcohol withdrawal · **beta-blockers**.

> [!danger] Non-selective beta-blockers worsen vasospasm — this inverts standard ACS management
> Blocking β2-mediated coronary vasodilatation leaves **unopposed α-mediated vasoconstriction**, intensifying the spasm. **Calcium channel blockers are first-line**, with long-acting nitrates as add-on.
> This is the **same** unopposed-alpha principle already stated for cocaine at §0.1 Mx and at [[14a-1_Psych_-_Substance_Misuse__Recreational_Drug_Profiles_]] — the corpus has the principle in the drug context and not in the disease context.

**S/Smx:** Rest and nocturnal angina, sometimes severe, with preserved exertional capacity. Syncope or palpitations if arrhythmia accompanies the spasm.

**Ix:** **ECG during pain** (*why:* the diagnosis rests on demonstrating transient ischaemic change that **resolves**, and an ECG taken after the pain has settled is normal — capturing one during an episode is the single most valuable investigation; *what:* transient ST elevation resolving completely). Ambulatory ECG monitoring (*why:* captures nocturnal and asymptomatic episodes that are otherwise never documented; *what:* transient ST shift). Troponin (*why:* may rise if spasm is prolonged; *what:* elevation). Coronary angiography (*why:* excludes fixed obstructive disease, which coexists in some patients; *what:* normal or non-obstructive arteries). **Urine toxicology for cocaine and amphetamines** (*why:* it changes the diagnosis, the treatment and the long-term advice, and the history is unreliable; *what:* stimulant use).

**Mx:**
- **Immediate/acute:** nitrates, which typically relieve the spasm rapidly. Calcium channel blocker. **Avoid beta-blockers.** Benzodiazepines where stimulant-related. Monitor for arrhythmia. `UNVERIFIED — agents and doses omitted, per eTG Cardiovascular.`
- **Definitive:** long-term calcium channel blocker, long-acting nitrate added if needed, cardiology involvement.
- **Chronic/long-term:** **smoking cessation is the single most effective intervention** and should be framed that way. Stimulant cessation with drug and alcohol support. Where chemotherapy-related, **document the agent as a contraindication** so it is not re-prescribed.

> [!info] MINOCA and INOCA — a troponin rise with normal arteries is not a false alarm
> **Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries** and **ischaemia with non-obstructive coronary arteries** are recognised entities. A patient with a genuine troponin rise and a normal angiogram has **not** had a false alarm — vasospasm, microvascular dysfunction, **spontaneous coronary artery dissection**, myocarditis and embolism all belong in that differential, and **the workup continues rather than stopping**.
> **Spontaneous coronary artery dissection specifically affects younger women, including peripartum**, and is frequently misattributed to anxiety. This is a different entity from the aortic dissection at §0.36.5 and shares only the word.

## 0.4 Atrial Fibrillation

**D:** Supraventricular tachyarrhythmia causing uncoordinated, ineffective atrial contraction. Divided into new-onset, paroxysmal, and persistent AF.

**R:** age, heavy alcohol use, smoking, HTN, ↑cholesterol, HF, T2DM, obesity, other heart disease, hyperthyroidism

**A:** [SMITH] Sepsis, Mitral valve pathology, IHD, Thyrotoxicosis, HTN

> [!warning] Added from unverified layer — the **acute** precipitants SMITH does not cover
> `SRC:B3_Arrhythmia__Bradycardia_and_Cardiac_Devices §0.4` `UNVERIFIED — model knowledge, not source-checked.`
> SMITH covers the chronic substrate and sepsis. New AF in an unwell patient is frequently a
> **symptom of the acute illness rather than a new cardiac diagnosis**, so also look for:
> **alcohol binge ("holiday heart")** — distinct from the chronic heavy use listed under R
> above · **pulmonary embolism** · **the post-operative state** · **electrolyte disturbance**
> · **obstructive sleep apnoea**.
> **Treating the rate without treating the precipitant is the common error** — and in sepsis
> the sepsis usually needs treating more than the rate does.

**P:** Anatomical/histological change in atria secondary to underlying heart disease → conductive changes.

**S/Smx:** palpitations, irregularly irregular pulse, SOB, chest pain, fatigue, dizziness, syncope

**Ix:** ECG (*why:* diagnostic — confirms the rhythm and rules out other arrhythmias; *what:* absent P waves, irregularly irregular narrow-complex rhythm). Bloods — FBC (*why:* screens for infection/anaemia as precipitants; *what:* may show leukocytosis if sepsis-driven), clotting profile (*why:* baseline before anticoagulation; *what:* baseline INR/APTT), U&E incl. Mg (*why:* electrolyte disturbance is a common precipitant and needs correction; *what:* hypokalaemia/hypomagnesaemia may be found), TFT (*why:* thyrotoxicosis is a classic reversible precipitant of AF; *what:* may show hyperthyroidism).

**Mx — haemodynamically unstable** (SBP <90, HR >150, syncope, chest pain): electrical cardioversion under the **ALS (Advanced Life Support)** algorithm

**Mx — stable, onset <48h:**
- Rate control: β-blocker or CCB ± digoxin
- Heparinise, then early rhythm control (electrical or pharmacological cardioversion)

**Mx — onset >48h or uncertain:**
- Rate control: β-blocker or CCB ± digoxin
- If rhythm control considered: anticoagulate ≥3 weeks before cardioversion, then elective electrical cardioversion
- Alternatively: transoesophageal echo (TOE) to exclude LAA thrombus — can heparinise and cardiovert sooner
- Catheter ablation if wishing to avoid antiarrhythmics: femoral access → radiofrequency ablation of aberrant myocardial focus; requires anticoagulation 4 weeks before/during procedure; stroke risk persists after ablation; 50% recur within 3 months and may need repeat procedures; risks include cardiac tamponade, stroke, pulmonary vein stenosis

**Rhythm control considered if:** reversible cause, HF secondary to AF, new-onset (<48h), or atrial flutter manageable with ablation.
- Electrical cardioversion synchronised to R wave (avoid inducing VF)
- Pharmacological: flecainide or amiodarone (latter if structural heart disease present)

### 0.4.1 Stroke/bleeding risk scoring

> [!info] CHA₂DS₂-VASc score
> Age 65–74yo = 1, ≥75yo = 2 | Sex: Male = 0, Female = 1 | Heart failure = 1 | Hypertension = 1 | Stroke/TIA/VTE = 2 | Vascular disease (prior MI, PAD) = 1 | Diabetes = 1

> [!info] **ORBIT bleeding score — 5 components, maximum 7**
> **O**lder age ≥75 (**1**) · **R**educed haemoglobin/haematocrit, or history of anaemia (**2**) · **B**leeding history — GI bleed, ICH, haemorrhagic stroke (**2**) · **I**nsufficient renal function, eGFR <60 (**1**) · **T**reatment with an antiplatelet (**1**).
> *The acronym is the component list. Low 0–2 · Medium 3 · High ≥4.*

> [!warning] **Correction found by the scoring-tool arithmetic check (2026-08-29).** This box previously listed **four** components summing to 5, and omitted **reduced haemoglobin/anaemia** — which is not a minor omission: it is one of the two 2-point items and, in the derivation study, **the component most strongly associated with major bleeding**. A score built from the remaining four understates risk in exactly the patients the tool exists to identify.
>
> The check that caught it needs no source: **the acronym has five letters and the box listed four.** Noted also that I wrote the interpretation box below this one in an earlier round, advising that a "correctable anaemia" is among the modifiable bleeding risks — without noticing that anaemia was a *scored component* that had been dropped from the list two lines above. See `PENDING_GUIDELINE_CHECKS.md` **B46**.

> [!danger] **What the two scores are *for* — the components above are not the useful part, and the way they are read wrongly is predictable.** The corpus lists both scores' points and, until now, never said what to do with the answer.
>
> **CHA₂DS₂-VASc estimates stroke risk and it decides whether to anticoagulate.** Higher score, higher annual stroke risk, stronger indication.
>
> **ORBIT estimates bleeding risk and it does *not* decide whether to anticoagulate.** *The mechanism of the error:* a high bleeding score and a high stroke score usually occur in the **same patient** — age, hypertension, prior vascular events and renal impairment all load both — so using the bleeding score as a veto systematically withholds anticoagulation from the people with most to gain. A stroke prevented is generally a worse event avoided than the bleed risked.
>
> **What the bleeding score is actually for: identifying what you can modify.** Uncontrolled hypertension, concurrent antiplatelets without a current indication, NSAIDs, hazardous alcohol use, and a correctable anaemia are the actionable items. Score it, fix what is fixable, then anticoagulate anyway unless there is an absolute contraindication — and record that reasoning, because the decision looks wrong to anyone reading the numbers alone.

**Anticoagulation:** all patients — use CHA₂DS₂-VASc for stroke risk and ORBIT for bleeding risk.
- **CHA₂DS₂-VASc** ≥1 (male) or ≥2 (female): DOAC indefinitely. `UNVERIFIED — **R1** whether current Australian practice uses CHA₂DS₂-VASc or the newer CHA₂DS₂-VA, which REMOVES SEX as a criterion and would make this sex-split threshold obsolete. Corpus C (NEW_Exam_Manoeuvres_and_Procedures) writes "CHA₂DS₂-VA/VASc", naming both. Check against the Heart Foundation and Stroke Foundation, both open.` *(This threshold is the stroke score, not the bleeding score above it.)*
- Warfarin only if mechanical heart valves or severe mitral stenosis
- DOAC/warfarin also indicated for stroke/TIA + AF

> [!info] **Why DOAC-vs-warfarin is not only a clinical question (Step 10).** Warfarin requires **regular INR monitoring**; DOACs do not. For a patient a long way from a pathology service, that difference decides whether the drug is actually takeable — the monitoring burden, not the drug, is what fails. This is a specific, practical reason the DOAC-first position matters more for patients at distance from services than the guideline text alone suggests, and it is worth naming when the mechanical-valve/mitral-stenosis exception forces warfarin: that patient needs a monitoring plan built around where they live, not a standard clinic schedule.

**Complications:** stroke/TIA (5x increased risk vs non-AF), bradycardia, hypotension, heart failure, death. Amiodarone carries risk of thyroid dysfunction.

### 0.4.2 Explaining a new AF diagnosis to a patient

> [!note] Targeted patient-facing addition — explaining a new AF diagnosis (and the anticoagulation decision specifically) is a classic OSCE counselling station. See [[Communication]] for the general framework.

- Plain-language explanation: "Your heart's upper chambers are beating in a fast, disorganised way instead of a steady rhythm, so the heart isn't pumping quite as efficiently."
- Address the two separate decisions patients need to understand: (1) rate/rhythm control for symptoms, and (2) anticoagulation for stroke prevention — these are often conflated by patients ("if my heart rate is fine, why do I need blood thinners?"). Explicitly explain that AF increases stroke risk *regardless* of whether symptoms are controlled, because blood can pool and clot in the poorly-contracting atria even when the heart rate feels normal.
- Explain the stroke-risk-vs-bleeding-risk trade-off of anticoagulation in accessible terms, and that the CHA₂DS₂-VASc/ORBIT scores (section 0.4.1) are how this is calculated for their specific situation — avoid simply stating the scores/numbers without translating them.
- Correct the common fear that "blood thinners" mean any small cut becomes dangerous — explain realistically what the bleeding risk does and doesn't mean day-to-day.
- Explore the patient's own risk tolerance and preferences, particularly for older patients weighing stroke prevention against fall/bleeding risk — this is a shared decision, not a directive.
- Check understanding and invite questions before closing; safety-net for stroke/TIA symptoms specifically (FAST).

## 0.5 Advanced Life Support (Adult)

> [!info] Verified against ANZCOR Guidelines 11.2/11.5 (current as of 2025 ILCOR evidence review), Aug 2026 — **correction to an earlier note in this file: ANZCOR timing is NOT the same as the UK/ERC protocol** — adrenaline timing genuinely differs by one shock cycle, which changes the practical sequence below. This is a high-stakes correction (drug timing in cardiac arrest) — the bullet algorithm below has been updated to match.
> **Shockable (VF/pVT):** adrenaline 1mg after the **2nd** shock (not the 3rd, as in UK/ERC practice), then every 2nd loop (~4min) thereafter. Amiodarone 300mg directly after the 3rd shock, further 150mg after continued refractory VF/pVT (lidocaine as an alternative if amiodarone unavailable — do not give both).
> **Non-shockable (PEA/asystole):** adrenaline 1mg as soon as feasible, then every 2nd loop (~4min) — this part is consistent with UK/ERC practice.
> IV access preferred over IO.

**Recognition:** unresponsive, not breathing normally → start CPR 30:2, attach defib/monitor, assess rhythm.

- **Shockable (VF/pulseless VT):** 1 shock → immediately resume CPR for 2 min. If arrest witnessed, give 3 stacked shocks. **After the 2nd shock: adrenaline 1mg**, then repeat every 2nd loop (~3–5 min). After the 3rd shock: amiodarone 300mg; after continued refractory VF/pVT (~5th shock): amiodarone 150mg (or lidocaine).
- **Non-shockable (PEA/asystole):** immediately resume CPR for 2 min; give adrenaline 1 mg ASAP, then every other cycle (every 3–5 min).

**Supportive measures:**
- O2, maintain airway; aim for O2 sats 94–98%, normal PaCO2
- Waveform capnography
- Continuous compressions if advanced airway in place
- IV or IO access
- If PE suspected: give thrombolytic drugs, extend CPR to 60–90 min

> [!info] Reversible causes — the 4 H's and 4 T's
> Hypoxia, Hypovolaemia, Hypo/hyperkalaemia, Hypo/hyperthermia, Thrombosis (MI or PE), Tension pneumothorax, Tamponade (cardiac), Toxins

**Rhythm definitions:**
- VF/VT: ventricular tachyarrhythmia causing unsynchronised, ineffective ventricular contractions
- PEA: organised electrical rhythm (e.g. sinus tachycardia) present on monitor but no detectable pulse
- Asystole: cessation of electrical and mechanical activity; usually a decompensation of VT/VF/PEA; poor prognosis unless secondary to choking or pacemaker failure; neurological deficits common even in survivors

**Ix:** 12-lead ECG (*why:* identifies the rhythm and any precipitating ischaemia post-ROSC; *what:* confirms shockable vs non-shockable rhythm during arrest; may show STEMI post-ROSC needing urgent PCI). CXR (*why:* checks endotracheal tube position and screens for a reversible cause, e.g. tension pneumothorax; *what:* tube position, pneumothorax, pulmonary oedema). ABG (*why:* guides ventilation and identifies reversible metabolic causes; *what:* hypoxia, acidosis, electrolyte derangement — see 4H's/4T's below). ROSC = return of spontaneous circulation.

---

## 0.6 Ventricular Fibrillation

**D:** Ventricular tachyarrhythmia causing unsynchronised, ineffective contraction of the ventricles ("quiver").

**R:** CAD, acute MI, HOCM, long/short QT, Brugada syndrome, ventricular pre-excitation (e.g. WPW), electrolyte imbalance, drugs, infection

**A/P:** Anatomical/histological change in cardiac tissue (especially scarring) due to underlying heart disease, resulting in conductive change.

**S/Smx:** tachycardia, hypotension, (pre)syncope, airway compromise, impaired consciousness, chest discomfort, dyspnoea

**Ix:** ECG (*why:* diagnostic, confirms rhythm; *what:* chaotic, irregular, no identifiable QRS complexes — "wide QRS complex, irregularly irregular pattern" as noted). FBC (*why:* screens for infection/anaemia as precipitants; *what:* may show leukocytosis). Clotting profile (*why:* baseline before any subsequent anticoagulation if AF develops post-cardioversion; *what:* baseline INR/APTT). U&E (*why:* electrolyte disturbance is a common arrhythmia precipitant; *what:* hypokalaemia/hypomagnesaemia). TFT (*why:* thyrotoxicosis as a reversible precipitant; *what:* may show hyperthyroidism). CXR (*why:* screens for structural/pulmonary precipitants; *what:* cardiomegaly, pulmonary oedema). TTE (*why:* assesses underlying structural heart disease driving the arrhythmia and post-arrest LV function; *what:* may show HOCM, prior infarct scar, reduced EF).

**Mx – Immediate/acute:** DC cardioversion stat ± amiodarone or lidocaine (as per ALS algorithm, section 0.5).

**Mx – Chronic/long-term:** ICD, anti-arrhythmic medications.

**P:** ICD results in better outcomes.

> [!note] Ventricular pre-excitation
> Slurring of the R wave due to an abnormal AV conduction pathway that activates the ventricles before the normal impulse conducts down the AV node/Bundle of His (accessory pathway, e.g. WPW).

---

## 0.7 Ventricular Tachycardia

**D:** Broad-complex tachycardia originating from a ventricular ectopic focus. QRS >120 ms, rate >100 bpm.
- Monomorphic VT — most commonly caused by MI
- Polymorphic VT — one subtype is torsade de pointes (secondary to QT prolongation)

**Ix:** ECG (*why:* diagnostic, confirms broad-complex tachycardia and distinguishes monomorphic from polymorphic; *what:* QRS >120ms, rate >100, AV dissociation/capture beats support VT over SVT with aberrancy). Bloods — U&E incl. Mg, Ca (*why:* electrolyte disturbance is a common precipitant, especially relevant for torsade de pointes; *what:* hypokalaemia/hypomagnesaemia/hypocalcaemia may be found). Troponin (*why:* screens for underlying MI as the cause; *what:* elevated if ischaemic trigger). TTE (*why:* assesses structural heart disease/LV function guiding long-term risk and ICD decision; *what:* may show scar, reduced EF, HOCM).

**Mx if unstable** (SBP <90, HF, chest pain, syncope): immediately cardiovert (DC), treat under ALS algorithm.

**Mx if stable:** amiodarone (loading dose then 24h infusion), or lidocaine/procainamide; + ICD if drug therapy fails or LV function impaired.

> [!tip] Added from unverified layer — the rest of the VT-versus-SVT discriminators
> `SRC:B3_Arrhythmia__Bradycardia_and_Cardiac_Devices §0.3` `UNVERIFIED — model knowledge, not source-checked. Formal algorithm criteria (Brugada, Vereckei) omitted.`
> The Ix line above names **AV dissociation and capture beats**. The set is completed by:
> - **Fusion beats** — a hybrid morphology, essentially diagnostic alongside capture beats.
> - **Precordial concordance** — every QRS across V1–V6 positive, or every one negative.
> - **Extreme axis deviation** and a **very broad QRS**.
> - **Known structural heart disease or prior MI** — clinically the single most useful discriminator, and the one that needs no ECG.
>
> **None of this changes the safe decision**, which the §0.12.4 line already states: assume VT. Treating VT as SVT is dangerous; treating SVT as VT is usually harmless.

**Mx of torsade de pointes:** Mg sulphate.

> [!danger] Do NOT use verapamil in VT.

## 0.8 Bradycardia: Peri-arrest

**D:** Abnormally slow HR causing haemodynamic compromise; defined as <50 bpm.

**R:** medications, >70yo, recent MI, surgery

**A:** sinus node dysfunction, conduction system disease (including AV block), escape rhythms, AV dissociation

**S/Smx:** dizziness, syncope, fatigue, exercise intolerance, dyspnoea, jugular venous distension (with a-waves)

**Ix:** ABG (*why:* assesses oxygenation, a reversible contributor; *what:* may show hypoxia). Bloods — TFTs (*why:* hypothyroidism is a reversible cause of bradycardia; *what:* may show hypothyroidism), U&Es (*why:* electrolyte disturbance, especially hyperkalaemia, causes bradyarrhythmia; *what:* may show hyperkalaemia), troponin (*why:* screens for MI, especially inferior MI which is associated with AV block; *what:* may be elevated). 12-lead ECG (*why:* diagnostic, identifies the specific bradyarrhythmia/block type; *what:* see AV block classification in section 0.12.3). Holter monitoring (*why:* captures intermittent bradyarrhythmia not seen on a single ECG; *what:* documents frequency/severity/correlation with symptoms). Exercise testing or event monitor (*why:* assesses chronotropic competence and reproduces symptoms if exertional; *what:* may show failure of appropriate HR rise). Echo (*why:* screens for structural heart disease as a cause/contributor; *what:* usually normal in isolated conduction disease).

**Mx – Immediate/acute:**
- O2, aim for 94–98%
- Atropine boluses to total 3 mg (500 mcg boluses); contraindicated in heart transplant patients
- If bradycardia secondary to β-blocker or CCB: give glucagon
- If secondary to digoxin: call expert help
- Transcutaneous pacing; isoprenaline/adrenaline/dopamine — consider if risk of asystole or no response to atropine
- Drug options if pacing unavailable

> [!warning] Risk factors for asystole: recent asystole, Mobitz II AV block, complete heart block, ventricular pauses >3s.

**Mx – Chronic/long-term:** permanent pacemaker for persistent symptomatic bradycardia or high-risk conduction disease not attributable to a reversible cause — see indications in section 0.10 below.

---

## 0.9 Tachycardia: Peri-arrest

**D:** ↑HR, generally >100 bpm.

**Classification:**
| | Regular | Irregular |
|---|---|---|
| Broad complex | Assume VT | AF + bundle branch block, AF with ventricular pre-excitation, TdP |
| Narrow complex | SVT | Probably AF |

### 0.9.1 Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)
Regular narrow-complex tachycardia not ventricular in origin. QRS <80 ms, usually HR 150–220. Causes: AV nodal re-entry tachycardia (AVNRT), AV re-entry tachycardia (AVRT), junctional tachycardia.

**Ix:** ECG (*why:* diagnostic, confirms regular narrow-complex tachycardia; *what:* QRS <80ms, HR 150–220, often no visible P waves). Bloods — U&Es (*why:* electrolyte disturbance can precipitate/perpetuate SVT; *what:* may show hypokalaemia/hypomagnesaemia), troponin (*why:* screens for demand ischaemia from the tachycardia itself, or an ischaemic trigger; *what:* may be mildly elevated from rate-related strain, or elevated if ischaemic cause).

**Mx — stable SVT:** Valsalva manoeuvre (e.g. blowing into an empty plastic syringe), carotid sinus massage

**Mx — unstable SVT:**
- Adenosine IV: rapid bolus 6 mg → no effect, 12 mg → no effect, further 12 mg (max 3 doses; some sources describe an 18 mg third dose but 12 mg is the standard eTG/AMH-aligned third dose)

> [!danger] Adenosine contraindicated in asthmatics — give verapamil instead.

- Electrical cardioversion

**Long-term Mx:** β-blockers, radio-frequency ablation

> [!tip] Valsalva manoeuvre — forced expiration against a closed glottis. Can terminate SVT or normalise middle-ear pressures.

#### Added from unverified layer — do the Valsalva properly

> It is free, it works in a meaningful proportion of SVT, and **doing it well is worth more
> than doing it early** — the Mx line above lists it first for a reason, and a poorly

## 0.10 Pacemakers

**Temporary pacemakers** — used in:
- haemodynamically unstable bradycardia not responding to atropine
- acute anterior MI
- trifascicular block prior to surgery

**Implanted cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)** — indicated for:
- complete AV block
- Mobitz type II AV block
- persistent AV block after anterior MI
- symptomatic bradycardias (e.g. sick sinus syndrome)
- heart failure
- drug-resistant tachyarrhythmias

Ventricular pacing and sensing ICDs are most commonly used. Shows up on ECG with a pacing spike.

## 0.11 Cardiac Enzymes

| Marker | Rise begins | Peak | Returns to normal |
|---|---|---|---|
| Troponin (most commonly used) | 4–6h | 12–24h | 7–10d |
| CK-MB (most useful for reinfarction) | 2–6h | 16–20h | 2–3d |
| Myoglobin (rises first) | 1–2h | 6–8h | 1–2d |
| CK | 4–8h | 16–24h | 3–4d |
| AST | 12–24h | 36–48h | 3–4d |
| LDH | 24–48h | 72h | 8–10d |

## 0.12 ECG Interpretation

**Normal ranges:** PR 120–200 ms | QRS 80–100 ms | QTc 360–440 ms (M), 360–460 ms (F)
QTc = corrected QT interval; estimates QT at a standard HR of 60 bpm.
Usual ECG settings: voltage 10 mV, speed 25 mm/s.

### 0.12.1 P wave
- ↑Amplitude → cor pulmonale
- Broad, notched (bifid) — often most pronounced in lead II; ≈ left atrial enlargement; seen in mitral stenosis
- Absent P wave → atrial fibrillation

### 0.12.2 PR interval
- **Prolonged (>200 ms):** ischaemic heart disease, digoxin toxicity, hypokalaemia, rheumatic fever, aortic root pathology, Lyme disease, sarcoidosis, myotonic dystrophy, idiopathic, athletes
- **Short:** Wolff-Parkinson-White (δ wave)

### 0.12.3 AV blocks
> [!info] Heart block classification
> - **1st degree:** PR >200 ms
> - **2nd degree Type 1 (Mobitz I, Wenckebach):** progressively prolonging PR until a dropped beat occurs
> - **2nd degree Type 2 (Mobitz II):** constant PR interval between dropped beats
> - **3rd degree (complete):** dissociation between P waves and QRS complexes; if post-MI, think RCA lesion

#### Added from unverified layer — *where* the block sits is what decides urgency
`SRC:B3_Arrhythmia__Bradycardia_and_Cardiac_Devices §0.5` `UNVERIFIED — model knowledge, not source-checked.`

> [!danger] Mobitz I and Mobitz II are not two grades of the same thing
> The box above separates them on the **PR interval**. The reason that matters is **anatomical**:
> - **Mobitz I is usually within the AV node.** Often vagally mediated or drug-related, **atropine-responsive**, and it rarely progresses. Generally benign.
> - **Mobitz II is infranodal — in the His-Purkinje system.** It is therefore **not reliably atropine-responsive**, it **progresses unpredictably to complete heart block**, and it usually needs pacing. **This is the dangerous one**, which is why §0.8 lists it among the risk factors for asystole.
> - **In third-degree block the escape tells you the level:** a **narrow** escape suggests a junctional origin and relative stability; a **broad, slow** escape suggests a ventricular origin and is unstable.

> [!tip] Added from unverified layer — bradycardia with a **wide QRS**: check a gas before you pace
> `SRC:B3_Arrhythmia__Bradycardia_and_Cardiac_Devices §0.5` `UNVERIFIED — model knowledge, not source-checked.`
> **Hyperkalaemia produces bradycardia with QRS widening**, peaked T waves and loss of P waves, progressing to a sine wave and arrest. It is fast to check, immediately treatable, and **will not respond to pacing**. See [[NEW_Drugs_07_Blood_and_Electrolytes]] for the treatment sequence.

### 0.12.4 QRS complex
- Normal: 80–100 ms
- Broad-complex tachycardia (>100–120 ms) — assume VT until otherwise proven
- Narrow-complex tachycardia — likely supraventricular (AVNRT, AVRT, junctional tachycardia)

### 0.12.5 Bundle branch blocks
| | Cause of slowed conduction | Causes | Mnemonic |
|---|---|---|---|
| RBBB | Slow/absent RBB conduction, longer RV depolarisation | Normal variant (↑age), RV hypertrophy, PE, MI | "MaRRoW" — M in V1, W in V6 |
| LBBB | Slow/absent LBB conduction, longer LV depolarisation | Acute MI, aortic stenosis, HTN | "WiLLiaM" — W in V1, M in V6. A new LBBB is always assumed to be MI until otherwise proven |

**Fascicular blocks (hemiblocks)** — the left bundle branch splits into anterior and posterior fascicles; block of one in isolation (without a full bundle branch block pattern) causes a characteristic axis shift without QRS widening beyond the fascicular-block range (typically <120ms, distinguishing isolated hemiblock from a full bundle branch block):
- **Left anterior fascicular block (LAFB):** left axis deviation (more marked than −45°) with a small Q wave and tall R wave in lead I/aVL (qR pattern), small R wave and deep S wave in II/III/aVF (rS pattern) — the anterior fascicle is thinner and more vulnerable, making LAFB the more common isolated hemiblock of the two.
- **Left posterior fascicular block (LPFB):** right axis deviation with a small R wave and deep S wave in I/aVL (rS pattern), small Q wave and tall R wave in II/III/aVF (qR pattern) — genuinely rarer in isolation than LAFB, since the posterior fascicle is thicker and has a dual blood supply, so isolated LPFB should prompt consideration of significant underlying conduction system disease rather than being dismissed as an incidental finding.

**Bi-fascicular block:** RBBB + left anterior or posterior hemiblock (→ RBBB + left/right axis deviation)

**Tri-fascicular block:** RBBB + left hemiblock + 3rd degree heart block

> [!note] Source discrepancy: PassMed describes tri-fascicular block as above with 1st degree block, but LITFL states true trifascicular block requires 3rd degree heart block.

### 0.12.6 Axis deviation
| | ECG pattern | Causes |
|---|---|---|
| Left axis deviation (LAD) | QRS +ve lead I; −ve leads II, III, aVF | Left anterior hemiblock, LBBB, inferior MI, WPW (right-sided accessory pathway), hyperkalaemia, congenital ASD |
| Right axis deviation (RAD) | QRS −ve lead I; +ve leads II, III, aVF | RV hypertrophy, left posterior hemiblock, lateral MI, cor pulmonale, PE, WPW (left-sided accessory pathway), normal in infants <1yo |

### 0.12.7 ST segment
- **Elevation:** MI (STEMI), pericarditis/myocarditis (diffuse elevation + PR depression), normal variant ("high take-off"), LV aneurysm, Prinzmetal angina (coronary artery spasm), Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (difficult to differentiate from MI), subarachnoid haemorrhage (rare)
- **Depression:** MI (NSTEMI), secondary to abnormal QRS (LVH, LBBB, RBBB), digoxin, hypokalaemia, cardiac syndrome X

### 0.12.8 T wave
Represents ventricular repolarisation. "Inversion" is normal in aVR and V1.
- **Peaked:** hyperkalaemia, MI
- **Inverted:** MI, digoxin toxicity, subarachnoid haemorrhage, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, PE (S1Q3T3 — most commonly presents with sinus tachycardia), Brugada syndrome

### 0.12.9 Chamber hypertrophy/enlargement
- **LVH:** sum of S wave in V1 + R wave in V5 or V6 >40 mm
- **RVH:** left atrial enlargement — bifid P wave in lead II, duration >120 ms; right atrial enlargement — tall P waves in leads II and V1 exceeding 25 ms

### 0.12.10 Normal variants in athletes
Sinus bradycardia, junctional escape rhythm, first degree heart block, second degree Mobitz I

### 0.12.11 Hypothermia
Bradycardia, J wave (Osborne wave — small hump at end of QRS), 1st degree heart block, long QT interval, atrial and ventricular arrhythmias

## 0.13 Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) Syndrome

**D:** Congenital cardiac condition arising from an accessory pathway between the atrium and ventricle. Type A = left-sided pathway; Type B = right-sided pathway.

**R:** Ebstein anomaly, other cardiac defects, HOCM, possible family history

**A/P:** Accessory pathway can lead to atrioventricular re-entry tachycardia (AVRT) → can degenerate to AF/VF.

**S/Smx:** may be asymptomatic, or present with palpitations, dizziness, dyspnoea, chest pain.

**Ix:** ECG (*why:* diagnostic; *what:* short PR interval, δ wave — wide QRS with slurred upstroke, LAD/RAD; Type A: dominant R wave in V1; Type B: no dominant R wave) ± echo (*why:* screens for associated structural defects e.g. Ebstein anomaly, HOCM; *what:* may show associated lesion), electrophysiology study (*why:* localises the accessory pathway and risk-stratifies before ablation; *what:* confirms pathway location and conduction properties).

**Mx:** radiofrequency ablation of accessory pathway (safe and effective); medical — sotalol, amiodarone, flecainide (avoid sotalol in coexistent AF).

## 0.14 Junctional Escape Rhythm

**D:** Isolated QRS complexes, usually rate 40–60 bpm, usually narrow (<120 ms), no relationship between QRS complexes and preceding atrial activity. Also known as junctional rhythm. Arises when the rate of supraventricular impulses is less than impulses arising from the AV node.

---

## 0.15 Wellens' Syndrome

**D:** ECG pattern arising from high-grade stenosis in the left anterior descending coronary artery.

> [!danger] Needs urgent PCI referral — very high risk of progression to ACS.

**Ix:** ECG (*why:* diagnostic; *what:* biphasic or deep T wave inversion in V2–3, minimal ST elevation, no Q waves — pattern is often seen when pain-free, so a "normal-looking" ECG during symptoms doesn't exclude it).

---

## 0.16 Long QT Syndrome

**D:** Congenital or acquired condition characterised by a prolonged QT interval.

> [!info] QTc is prolonged if
> \>440 ms in men (>2.2 big squares); >460 ms in women (>2.6 big squares)

**Causes of long QT:**
- Congenital — Jervell-Lange-Nielsen, Romano-Ward
- Anti-arrhythmics: amiodarone, sotalol, class 1a antiarrhythmics
- TCAs, SSRIs (especially citalopram)
- Antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol)
- Chloroquines, terfenadine, erythromycin, ondansetron
- Electrolyte disturbance: ↓Ca, ↓K, ↓Mg
- Myocarditis, hypothermia, SAH/large brain bleeds

**S/Smx:** commonly presents in young people with cardiac arrest or unexplained syncope; frequently misdiagnosed as epilepsy.
- Cardiac syncope: premonitory palpitations, chest pain, dyspnoea → syncope (with pallor, cyanosis) → recovery with flushing

> [!warning] Identify trigger: LQTS1/2 — excitement, ↑adrenergic tone; LQTS3 — rest, bradycardia; acquired — drugs, electrolyte imbalance.

**Ix:** ECG (*why:* diagnostic — measures QTc; *what:* prolonged QTc, see thresholds above). Bloods — K, Mg, Ca (*why:* electrolyte disturbance can cause acquired QT prolongation and needs correction; *what:* hypokalaemia/hypomagnesaemia/hypocalcaemia may be found or contributing). Consider Holter monitor (*why:* captures intermittent QT prolongation/arrhythmia not seen on a single ECG; *what:* documents QT behaviour and any arrhythmic events), exercise tolerance test (*why:* LQTS1 classically worsens with exertion, useful for genotype clues and risk stratification; *what:* abnormal QT response to exercise), genetic testing (*why:* confirms congenital subtype, guides genotype-specific management and family screening; *what:* identifies causative mutation e.g. KCNQ1/KCNH2/SCN5A).

**Mx:** lifestyle modification, β-blocker (propranolol or metoprolol); avoid extreme exertion, QT-prolonging drugs, electrolyte imbalance; ICD if prior cardiac arrest + symptoms despite β-blocker
**Mx of torsade de pointes:** IV Mg sulphate

**P:** asymptomatic patients may have normal life expectancy. Symptoms + ≥1 syncopal episodes → risk of recurrence. Symptoms + cardiac arrest → markedly increased risk; survival improved by β-blocker and ICD.

---

## 0.17 Short QT Syndrome

**D:** Inheritable condition with a shortened QT interval — QTc ≤330 ms, or <360 ms plus one of: Hx of cardiac arrest/syncope, family Hx of sudden cardiac death ≤40yo, family Hx of SQTS.

**A:** electrolyte imbalances (↑K, ↑Ca), hyperthermia, acidosis, endocrine disorders

**S/Smx:** lone AF without structural heart disease, ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac arrest, ± palpitations/syncope/AF; may be asymptomatic, picked up on screening. Mean age at diagnosis 23yo, more common in males.

**Ix:** ECG (*why:* diagnostic — measures QTc; *what:* shortened QTc, see thresholds above). Bloods — K, Mg, Ca (*why:* screens for the electrolyte/metabolic causes listed above; *what:* may show hyperkalaemia/hypercalcaemia). Consider Holter monitor (*why:* captures arrhythmic events not seen on a single ECG; *what:* documents any AF/ventricular arrhythmia), exercise tolerance test (*why:* assesses QT behaviour with rate change; *what:* QTc fails to lengthen appropriately with slower rates), genetic testing (*why:* confirms diagnosis and enables family screening; *what:* identifies causative ion-channel mutation, though a specific gene is only found in a minority). (though patients may get inappropriately shocked due to interpretation difficulties) ± hydroquinidine (prolongs QT)

---

## 0.18 Brugada Syndrome

**D:** Inherited cardiac disease with a typical ECG pattern.

> [!info] Epidemiology: prevalence ≥0.2%, with ≥1 in 500 in Iran and Thailand.

**A:** disorder of myocardial Na channels causing variable repolarisation; characteristic J-point elevation, downward ST in V1–2 ("saddle-back" pattern)

**Ix:** ECG (*why:* diagnostic — most patients are asymptomatic and identified incidentally or via family screening; *what:* characteristic Type 1 "coved" ST elevation ≥2mm in V1–2 with J-point elevation and T-wave inversion, or the less specific "saddle-back" Type 2/3 pattern). Provocation testing with a Na-channel blocker (e.g. ajmaline/flecainide) (*why:* unmasks a concealed/borderline Brugada pattern in patients with a suggestive history or family history but a non-diagnostic resting ECG; *what:* converts a Type 2/3 pattern to a diagnostic Type 1 pattern if positive). Genetic testing (*why:* confirms an SCN5A mutation in a minority of cases and enables cascade family screening; *what:* positive in ~20–30% of clinically diagnosed cases).

**S/Smx:** cardiac arrest, VTach, VF

**Mx:**
- **Immediate/acute** (VT/VF arrest): defibrillation/ALS algorithm (section 0.5); avoid Na-channel-blocking drugs and other Brugada-aggravating drugs (many antiarrhythmics, some antidepressants/antipsychotics — check a Brugada drug safety list before prescribing); treat fever aggressively (fever unmasks the ECG pattern and can precipitate arrhythmia).
- **Definitive:** ICD in symptomatic patients (prior cardiac arrest, documented VT, or unexplained syncope with a Type 1 pattern) ± quinidine (reduces arrhythmic events, an option for those declining/ineligible for ICD, or as an adjunct) or catheter ablation of the arrhythmogenic substrate (emerging option for recurrent ICD shocks).
- **Chronic/long-term:** avoid precipitants (fever — treat promptly with antipyretics; excessive alcohol; cocaine; Brugada-aggravating drugs); cascade family screening given the inherited (typically autosomal dominant) nature; asymptomatic patients with an incidental Type 1 pattern and no other risk features are generally managed with risk-factor avoidance and monitoring rather than ICD.

## 0.19 Atrial Flutter

**D:** Supraventricular tachyarrhythmia characterised by a succession of rapid atrial depolarisation waves.

**R:** ↑age, valvular dysfunction, atrial septal defect, atrial dilation

**S/Smx:** palpitations, fatigue/lightheadedness, JVP pulsation with rapid flutter or cannon waves

**Ix:** ECG (*why:* diagnostic; *what:* "saw-tooth" flutter waves, best seen in leads II, III, aVF, V1; 2:1 AV block is common, giving a characteristically regular ventricular rate ~150bpm — a useful clue distinguishing it from AF). Bloods — U&E, TFT (*why:* screens for electrolyte disturbance and thyrotoxicosis as reversible precipitants, as for AF; *what:* may show hypokalaemia or hyperthyroidism). Echo (*why:* assesses underlying structural heart disease/atrial dilation driving the arrhythmia; *what:* may show valvular disease, atrial enlargement).

**Mx:**
- **Immediate/acute (haemodynamically unstable):** electrical cardioversion under the ALS algorithm, as for unstable AF.
- **Definitive:** managed similarly to AF overall (rate/rhythm control, anticoagulation per CHA₂DS₂-VASc) but is more sensitive to electrical cardioversion (lower energy levels are often effective). Catheter ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus is first-line definitive therapy for typical atrial flutter (higher success rate than AF ablation, given the more predictable re-entrant circuit) and is often offered earlier than in AF.
- **Chronic/long-term:** anticoagulation decisions follow the same CHA₂DS₂-VASc-based approach as AF (see section 0.4.1) given the same thromboembolic risk; rate control (β-blocker/CCB) if ablation isn't pursued or as a bridge.

## 0.20 Shock

**D:** Life-threatening acute circulatory failure causing cellular and tissue hypoxia.

> [!danger] General Mx — Immediate/acute (ABCDE, applies to all shock types before the type-specific Mx below)
> - 2x wide-bore cannulas ASAP
> - Bloods: ABG/VBG, group & save + X-match if transfusion needed, troponin (cardiogenic), blood cultures (septic)
> - IV fluids — 500 mL bolus + further fluids according to response
> - Further Mx according to type of shock (see below)

> [!tip] Mnemonic "Nacho+": Neurogenic, Anaphylactic, Cardiogenic, Hypovolaemic, Obstructive, other misc causes (e.g. mitochondrial failure) — from *Deranged Physiology*

### 0.20.1 Cardiogenic shock
Pump failure (heart cannot pump blood around the body).
**A:** MI, arrhythmias, toxic substances (alcohol, other drugs), heart failure, chest trauma
**S/smx:** ↓BP, ↑HR, ↑RR
**Ix:** troponin (*why:* identifies MI as the precipitant; *what:* elevated if ischaemic cause), ECG (*why:* identifies the precipitating rhythm/ischaemia; *what:* STEMI changes, arrhythmia), echo (*why:* confirms pump failure and its mechanism/severity at the bedside; *what:* severely reduced LV function, regional wall motion abnormality, or mechanical complication e.g. acute MR/VSD)
**Mx:**
- **Immediate/acute:** ABCDE as above; loop diuretic if fluid-overloaded; vasopressors/inotropes (e.g. dobutamine, noradrenaline — specialist-guided); mechanical circulatory support (e.g. IABP, ECMO) in refractory cases.
- **Definitive:** treat the underlying cause — urgent PCI if MI-driven, antiarrhythmic/cardioversion if arrhythmia-driven, surgical repair if mechanical complication.
- **Chronic/long-term:** manage as per chronic heart failure (section 0.27) once stabilised.
**P:** very high mortality if occurring secondary to MI

### 0.20.2 Hypovolaemic shock
Decreased intravascular volume.

> [!info] Haemorrhagic shock classification by blood loss
> Class I: <750 mL | Class II: 750–1500 mL | Class III: 1500–2000 mL | Class IV: >2000 mL

**A:** haemorrhage, dehydration, GI loss, third-spacing (e.g. hypoalbuminaemia)
**S/smx:** ↓BP, ↑HR, ↑RR; may have obvious wound/bleeding, but internal bleeding may not be obvious
**Ix:** bloods, especially group & save + X-match (*why:* prepares for transfusion if haemorrhagic; *what:* determines blood type/compatibility — note Hb may not accurately reflect acute blood loss, since haemodilution takes time, so treat clinically rather than by Hb alone); may need exploratory surgery/endoscopy (*why:* to identify and control an occult bleeding source when not clinically obvious; *what:* localises the bleeding site).
**Mx:**
- **Immediate/acute:** ABCDE as above ± major haemorrhage protocol (blood products in fixed ratios) if haemorrhagic.
- **Definitive:** source control — surgical/endoscopic/interventional-radiological haemostasis if haemorrhagic; rehydration and treat the underlying cause if non-haemorrhagic (GI losses, third-spacing).
- **Chronic/long-term:** address the underlying cause to prevent recurrence (e.g. investigate and treat the source of chronic GI blood loss).

### 0.20.3 Distributive shock
Failure of vasoregulation — further divided into septic, anaphylactic, and neurogenic shock.

**Septic shock**
Systemic immune response to infection (including cytokine storm) → increased peripheral vasodilation.
**S/smx:** as per sepsis — ↑temp, warm peripheries, ↑RR, ↑HR, WBC <4 or >12
**Ix:** blood cultures (*why:* identifies the causative organism to guide targeted antibiotic therapy; *what:* positive culture with organism and sensitivities, though often negative even in confirmed sepsis), ABG/VBG for lactate (*why:* lactate is a marker of tissue hypoperfusion and severity, and trends guide resuscitation response; *what:* elevated lactate correlates with severity/mortality), urine output monitoring (*why:* a simple continuous marker of end-organ (renal) perfusion; *what:* oliguria suggests inadequate perfusion), source-finding Ix if unknown (CXR, urine MC&S) (*why:* identifying and controlling the source is essential to definitive treatment; *what:* may reveal pneumonia, UTI, or other focus)
**Mx:**
- **Immediate/acute:** ABCDE as above + IV antibiotics (broad-spectrum, per the Sepsis/Surviving Sepsis "hour-1 bundle" principles — cultures before antibiotics where feasible but don't delay antibiotics for this) + fluid resuscitation; vasopressors (noradrenaline first-line) if fluid-refractory.
- **Definitive:** source control (drain an abscess, remove an infected line, etc.) + de-escalate antibiotics once cultures/sensitivities return.
- **Chronic/long-term:** not applicable acutely; post-sepsis, address any underlying immunocompromise/recurrent-source risk factors.

**Anaphylactic shock**
Systemic IgE-mediated hypersensitivity — massive mast cell degranulation → inflammation and vasodilation.
**S/smx:** ↓BP, ↑HR, ↑RR; facial/throat swelling, hives, difficulty breathing
**Ix:** clinical diagnosis (*why:* anaphylaxis is diagnosed and treated on clinical grounds — waiting for confirmatory testing would delay life-saving treatment; *what:* consistent with the S/Smx above); mast cell tryptase can be checked after treatment (*why:* retrospectively supports the diagnosis if it was unclear; *what:* elevated tryptase supports mast cell degranulation, though a normal level doesn't exclude anaphylaxis).

- **Definitive:** observation period post-resolution (biphasic reactions can occur hours later — duration depends on severity/local protocol); antihistamines and corticosteroids are adjuncts only, not substitutes for adrenaline.
- **Chronic/long-term:** allergy specialist referral, allergen identification/avoidance, adrenaline auto-injector prescription and training, medical alert identification.

**Neurogenic shock**
Interruption of the autonomic nervous system.
**A:** spinal cord transection
**S/smx:** ↓BP, ↓HR, ↑RR, warm flushed skin; ↓HR due to increased vagal response with no opposing sympathetic tone; if injury above C3, may progress to respiratory arrest
**Ix:** MRI whole spine (*why:* defines the level and nature of spinal cord injury, guiding urgent surgical decision-making; *what:* identifies the site/extent of cord compression or transection)
**Mx:**
- **Immediate/acute:** ABCDE; vasopressors (to counter unopposed vasodilation) and atropine (for bradycardia from unopposed vagal tone); maintain spinal precautions/immobilisation.
- **Definitive:** urgent neurosurgical referral — decompression/stabilisation surgery as indicated by the injury.
- **Chronic/long-term:** rehabilitation, autonomic dysreflexia monitoring/management, ongoing spinal injury multidisciplinary care.

### 0.20.4 Obstructive shock
Obstruction of blood flow → hypoperfusion of tissues distal to obstruction.
**A:** tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade
**Mx:**
- **Immediate/acute:** ABCDE; needle decompression for tension pneumothorax, pericardiocentesis for tamponade — mechanical obstruction requires mechanical relief, not just fluids/pressors.
- **Definitive:** chest drain insertion (pneumothorax) or definitive pericardial drainage/surgery (tamponade), treating the underlying cause (see sections 0.29 PE, 0.33 Tamponade).
- **Chronic/long-term:** dependent on underlying cause — e.g. anticoagulation if PE-driven obstruction (massive PE causing obstructive physiology).

| **Mx** | AF → anticoagulation. Asymptomatic → monitor with regular echos. Symptomatic → percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy or valve surgery | Medical: nitrates, diuretics, +ve inotropes, intra-aortic balloon pump. HF: ACEI, β-blockers, spironolactone. Surgical: repair if due to degeneration, otherwise replacement | Asymptomatic with valvular gradient >40 mmHg + LV systolic dysfunction → consider surgery. Symptomatic → valve replacement; balloon reserved for children/unfit-for-surgery adults | Medical Mx of HF. Symptomatic or asymptomatic with LV systolic dysfunction → surgery indicated |

> [!note] Gap-filled — the mechanism behind AS's classic exertional angina/syncope triad was stated in the table above without explanation. **Why exertional syncope occurs in aortic stenosis specifically:** the stenotic valve creates a relatively fixed cardiac output that cannot increase to meet the falling peripheral vascular resistance of exercise (normal exercise physiology relies on increased cardiac output alongside peripheral vasodilation to maintain blood pressure) — with output unable to rise, systemic BP falls during exertion, causing syncope. The same fixed-output mechanism explains exertional **angina** even without co-existing coronary artery disease, given the hypertrophied LV (from chronically pumping against the stenotic valve) has disproportionately high oxygen demand that a fixed, low cardiac output cannot adequately supply during exertion — this is precisely why AS symptoms are classically exertional rather than at rest, and why the onset of symptoms (rather than valve gradient alone) is a genuinely important trigger for considering surgical intervention.

> [!note] Gap-filled — "mitral facies" was listed as a mitral stenosis associated feature above without explaining what it is or why it occurs. **Mitral facies (also called "malar flush"):** a plum-coloured/bluish-red discolouration over the cheeks — the mechanism traces back to the same low-cardiac-output physiology underlying the rest of mitral stenosis's presentation: reduced cardiac output triggers peripheral vasoconstriction as a compensatory mechanism, but the resulting chronically poor peripheral perfusion, combined with CO2 retention from any associated pulmonary congestion, causes localised vasodilation specifically in the malar (cheek) capillaries — producing the characteristic flush. It's a genuinely reliable visual clue precisely because it reflects the underlying haemodynamic severity, not just an isolated cosmetic finding.

> [!note] Gap-filled — the AS cluster (slow-rising pulse, narrow pulse pressure, heaving apex) shares the same logic as the AR cluster below, but as the **mirror-image mechanism**: in AS, the stenotic valve restricts forward flow, so the LV ejects its stroke volume slowly and over a prolonged period rather than rapidly — this produces a **slow-rising ("anacrotic") pulse** (the peripheral pulse is felt to rise gradually rather than briskly) and a correspondingly **narrow pulse pressure** (systolic pressure rises only modestly, since the fixed, restricted outflow limits how high it can climb, while diastolic pressure remains relatively normal — the opposite quantitative pattern to AR's wide pulse pressure). The **heaving apex beat** reflects the LV hypertrophy that develops from chronically pumping against this fixed outflow resistance (a sustained, forceful contraction against the obstruction, rather than a volume-overloaded, displaced apex as in regurgitant lesions) — genuinely the same underlying "fixed obstruction to outflow" principle already established for AS's exertional syncope/angina above, now explaining the peripheral pulse and apex findings too, not a separate mechanism.

> [!note] Gap-filled — the cluster of AR peripheral signs (collapsing pulse, wide pulse pressure, De Musset's sign, Quincke's sign) were listed as bare named findings above with no shared explanation, despite all tracing back to a single mechanism. **The core mechanism, shared by all four:** in AR, the incompetent aortic valve allows blood to flow backward from the aorta into the LV during diastole — this produces a rapid, exaggerated rise in systolic pressure (a large stroke volume, since the LV ejects both the normal forward volume and the regurgitant volume it received back) followed by an equally rapid *fall* in diastolic pressure (as blood continues to leak backward into the LV rather than being held in the arterial system) — this rapid rise-and-fall pattern is the direct cause of every sign in this cluster, not four separate phenomena. **Wide pulse pressure** is simply this pattern quantified (high systolic, low diastolic). **Collapsing/"water-hammer" pulse**: the peripheral pulse is felt to rise rapidly then collapse away just as rapidly when palpated with the arm elevated — the physical sensation of the same rapid rise-and-fall transmitted to a peripheral artery. **De Musset's sign** (rhythmic head bobbing with each heartbeat) and **Quincke's sign** (visible capillary pulsation in the nailbed when light pressure is applied) are both peripheral manifestations of this same exaggerated pulse pressure being transmitted into small vessels and soft tissue — genuinely eponymous curiosities rather than separate pathophysiology, and their presence (or absence) roughly tracks with regurgitation severity given they all share this one underlying cause.

> [!info] Mx tiering for the table above — Immediate/acute: decompensated valvular disease presenting with acute pulmonary oedema/cardiogenic shock is managed as per acute heart failure (section 0.27.1) ± the medical measures in the table (nitrates/diuretics/inotropes for MR, avoiding nitrates in AS). Definitive: the surgical/percutaneous options in the table (valvotomy, repair, replacement, TAVI). Chronic/long-term: serial echo surveillance for asymptomatic disease not yet meeting intervention criteria, anticoagulation for AF, medical HF therapy alongside or in place of surgery where appropriate.

**Ix for valvular disease generally:** echo — *why:* first-line for diagnosis, quantifies severity (gradient, regurgitant volume), and assesses LV function/chamber size to guide the timing of intervention; *what:* valve-specific findings as above, quantified severity grade. ECG — *why:* screens for AF (common with mitral disease) and LVH (AS); *what:* AF, LVH pattern. CXR — *why:* screens for cardiomegaly and pulmonary congestion, and valve calcification; *what:* may show cardiomegaly, pulmonary oedema, calcified valve. Cardiac catheterisation — *why:* used when echo findings are discordant with symptoms, or to assess concurrent coronary disease before surgery; *what:* directly measures valve gradients/pressures and coronary anatomy.

> [!danger] Nitrates are contraindicated in aortic stenosis.

### 0.21.1 Murmurs — differential diagnosis
- **Pansystolic ("holosystolic"):** mitral/tricuspid regurgitation (TR louder on inspiration); ventricular septal defect (harsh)
- **Ejection systolic:** aortic stenosis, HOCM, pulmonary stenosis, atrial septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot
- **Late systolic:** mitral valve prolapse, coarctation of the aorta
- **Early diastolic:** aortic regurgitation; pulmonary regurgitation (Graham-Steel murmur — similar to AR)
- **Mid-diastolic:** mitral stenosis; severe aortic regurgitation (Austin-Flint murmur)
- **Continuous machine-like:** patent ductus arteriosus

> [!tip] Murmur mnemonics
> - **RILE:** right-sided murmurs best heard on inspiration; left-sided best heard on expiration
> - **ASMR:** Aortic Stenosis & Mitral Regurgitation during Systole
> - **ARMS:** Aortic Regurgitation & Mitral Stenosis during Diastole

### 0.21.2 Heart sounds
- **S1 ("lub"):** closure of mitral and tricuspid valves
- **S2 ("dub"):** closure of aortic and pulmonary valves; splitting on inspiration is normal
- **S3:** rapid ventricular filling during diastole; normal if <30yo, may persist in some women ≤50yo; also seen in LV failure (e.g. dilated cardiomyopathy), constrictive pericarditis, mitral regurgitation
- **S4:** atrial contraction against a stiff ventricle; seen in aortic stenosis, HTN, HOCM

### 0.21.3 Prosthetic heart valves
- **Biological:** usually bovine/porcine; structural deterioration and calcification over time; long-term anticoagulation not needed — aspirin long-term ± warfarin for first 3 months
- **Mechanical:** bileaflet valve most common now; low failure rate; increased thrombosis risk → requires long-term warfarin. Target INR is risk-stratified rather than a single flat figure per valve position — confirmed against 2025 ESC guidance and multiple contemporary sources, Aug 2026: **aortic position, modern bileaflet valve, no additional thrombotic risk factors** — target 2.5 (range 2.0–3.0); **aortic position WITH additional risk factors** (AF, prior thromboembolism, LV dysfunction/EF <35%, hypercoagulable state) **or an older-generation valve** (ball-in-cage, older tilting-disc) — target 3.0 (range 2.5–3.5); **any mechanical mitral (or tricuspid) valve** — target 3.0 (range 2.5–3.5) regardless of additional risk factors, given the inherently higher thrombotic risk of the mitral position. The file's original flat "3.0 aortic/3.5 mitral" figures correspond to the higher-risk-factor aortic tier and the mitral tier respectively — not wrong, but incomplete, since a risk-factor-free modern bileaflet aortic valve should actually target the lower 2.5 figure. Low-dose aspirin (75–100mg) is typically added to warfarin in mechanical valve patients per current guidance, an addition not in the original note. I still could not confirm the specific Australasian Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ASTH) document directly — the above reflects international (ESC/ACC-AHA-aligned) consensus, which Australian practice generally follows closely for this topic, but check ASTH directly for any AU-specific nuance before advising a specific patient.

### 0.21.4 Pulses
- **Pulsus paradoxus:** ≥10 mmHg fall in SBP on inspiration; seen in cardiac tamponade or severe asthma
- **Slow-rising:** aortic stenosis
- **Collapsing:** aortic regurgitation, patent ductus arteriosus, hyperkinetic states (anaemia, thyrotoxicosis)
- **Pulsus alternans:** alternating strong/weak beats; seen in severe LV failure
- **Bisferiens pulse:** double pulse with 2 systolic peaks; seen in mixed aortic valve disease, sometimes HOCM
- **"Jerky" pulse:** seen in HOCM

## 0.22 Rheumatic Fever

> [!note] See [[13_05a_ENT_-_Sore_Throat_and_Tonsillitis]] for the acute GAS pharyngitis management this condition is downstream of, including the genuinely important caveat that standard antibiotic-threshold scoring tools (Centor/FeverPAIN) don't apply the same way in populations at high risk of rheumatic fever, not repeated here. **Pharyngitis is not the only recognised trigger** — see [[09_05_Dermatology_-_Bacterial_Infections_and_Infestations]] Impetigo for the Australian-specific evidence that GAS *skin* infection can also trigger ARF, particularly relevant in Aboriginal children, not repeated here.

**D:** Autoimmune disease usually following *Strep. pyogenes* infection.

**P:** Type II hypersensitivity thought to be caused by molecular mimicry — M protein on *Strep. pyogenes* is structurally similar to myosin → cross-reactivity → autoimmune response against myosin in heart walls and arterial smooth muscle.

> [!info] S/Smx — major criteria "JONES"
> Joints (polyarthritis), carditis and valvulitis, subcutaneous Nodules, Erythema marginatum, Sydenham's chorea (late)

**Minor criteria:** ↑ESR/CRP, fever, arthralgia, prolonged PR interval

**Dx confirmed if:** evidence of recent strep infection AND (2 major criteria, OR 1 major + 2 minor criteria)

**Ix:** strep swabs (*why:* confirms current group A strep pharyngitis; *what:* positive culture/rapid antigen test), strep antibodies (ASOT/anti-DNase B) (*why:* confirms recent (rather than concurrent) strep infection, since throat swabs are often negative by the time RF symptoms appear; *what:* elevated/rising titre supports recent infection), ECG (*why:* screens for carditis (a major criterion) via conduction abnormality; *what:* prolonged PR interval — a minor criterion — or other conduction change), echo (*why:* assesses for subclinical or overt valvulitis/carditis, now recommended even without a murmur; *what:* may show valvular regurgitation, especially mitral).

**Mx:**
- **Immediate/acute:** oral penicillin V (eradicates residual strep infection — doesn't reverse established RF but is standard practice) plus NSAIDs for arthritis/fever symptom control; bed rest if carditis present.
- **Definitive:** treat complications as they occur — HF management if carditis causes decompensation, treat chorea symptomatically if severe.
- **Chronic/long-term:** secondary prophylaxis with long-term (often monthly IM) benzathine penicillin — duration depends on severity of carditis and risk of recurrent exposure, typically at least 10 years or into adulthood, longer/lifelong if significant carditis/valve damage — to prevent recurrent attacks and progression to rheumatic heart disease; regular echo follow-up for valve disease.

**P:** 30–50% of patients with rheumatic fever develop rheumatic heart disease — >70% if initial attack severe or ≥1 recurrence.

## 0.23 0.22a Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD)

> [!note] Gap-filled — previously only mentioned as a bare "aetiology" entry in the valve disease table and as a downstream complication note above, never built as its own entity. This is a genuinely significant omission given the scale of the Australian burden. Verified against SA Health's RHD Register program and MJA-published Northern Territory screening data, Aug 2026.

**D:** chronic valvular heart disease resulting from one or more episodes of acute rheumatic fever — the long-term structural consequence the secondary prophylaxis above is specifically trying to prevent.

**A/P:** repeated autoimmune valvulitis (per the rheumatic fever mechanism above) causes progressive valve leaflet thickening, fibrosis, and calcification — **mitral stenosis is the classic and most common lesion**, though any valve can be affected, with mitral regurgitation typical in earlier/less advanced disease and stenosis developing with more chronic, repeated damage.

> [!danger] A genuine, severe, and specifically Australian health equity issue — not a generic epidemiological footnote. RHD rates in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, particularly in remote Northern Territory communities, are among the **highest documented in the world** — a 2020 MJA-published echocardiographic screening study in one remote NT community found a definite-RHD prevalence of 5.4 per 100 people, exceeding rates reported almost anywhere else globally; national data show the large majority of new RHD diagnoses in Australia occur in Indigenous Australians, and disproportionately in those under 25. This isn't a rare disease nationally treated as an afterthought — it's a severe, active, ongoing health equity crisis in specific Australian communities.

**Ix:** **echocardiography is the definitive diagnostic tool**, per World Heart Federation criteria — and genuinely more sensitive than clinical examination alone; **active echocardiographic screening programs in high-risk communities detect substantial numbers of previously undiagnosed cases** (in the NT study above, 20 of 32 definite RHD cases found by screening were previously undetected), reflecting how much RHD in this population is genuinely under-recognised by passive case-finding (waiting for symptomatic presentation) alone.

**Mx:**
- **Definitive:** secondary prophylaxis (long-acting benzathine penicillin, per the duration/regimen already established in Rheumatic Fever above) remains the cornerstone of RHD control — genuinely capable of facilitating regression of early valvulitis and preventing progression if adherence is good, making prophylaxis adherence (not just its initial prescription) the single biggest lever for outcomes.
- **Severe/advanced disease:** valve repair or replacement, per the standard valvular heart disease principles established elsewhere in this file, not repeated here.
- **Chronic/long-term — the Australian-specific system worth knowing about:** each state/territory (e.g. SA Health's own RHD Register) maintains a **register of ARF/RHD patients** specifically to track secondary prophylaxis adherence, identify patients who have missed doses or moved between services, and coordinate ongoing care and education — a genuinely practical, system-level intervention addressing the fact that adherence to a monthly-injection regimen over many years is the actual limiting factor in RHD prevention, not a lack of medical knowledge about what to prescribe.

## 0.24 Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM/HCM)

**D:** Autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterised by LV hypertrophy without an identifiable cause. ~1:500 prevalence.

**R:** family history of HOCM or sudden cardiac death. Associated with Friedreich's ataxia, WPW.

**A/P:** Most common defect — mutation in the gene encoding β-myosin heavy chain protein or myosin-binding protein C.
- Results in predominantly diastolic dysfunction; LV hypertrophy → ↓compliance → ↓cardiac output
- Myofibrillar hypertrophy with chaotic, disorganised myocytes ('disarray') and fibrosis

**S/Smx:** can be asymptomatic
- Exertional dyspnoea, angina, syncope (usually after exercise; secondary to functional aortic stenosis)
- Sudden death (usually secondary to ventricular arrhythmia), HF
- Jerky pulse, large 'a' waves, double apex beat
- Systolic murmurs: ejection systolic (↑ with Valsalva, ↓ with squatting); pansystolic murmur due to mitral regurgitation

**Ix:** ECG (*why:* screens for LVH and arrhythmia which are near-universal even before symptoms; *what:* LVH criteria, deep Q waves, AF, non-specific changes). Echo (*why:* diagnostic — directly visualises hypertrophy pattern and outflow obstruction; *what:* asymmetric septal hypertrophy, mitral regurgitation, systolic anterior motion of the anterior mitral valve leaflet — "MR SAM ASH"). Genetic testing/family screening (*why:* confirms diagnosis in ambiguous cases and identifies at-risk relatives for cascade screening; *what:* identifies a sarcomeric gene mutation in the majority). Holter monitor (*why:* screens for non-sustained VT, an important risk-stratifying feature for sudden death risk/ICD decision; *what:* may show NSVT).

**Mx:**
- **Immediate/acute:** if presenting with syncope/arrhythmia — manage as per the relevant arrhythmia (sections 0.6–0.9) and refer urgently; avoid dehydration/exertion in known HOCM.

> [!info] Mx mnemonic "ABCDE" (Definitive/chronic — medical and device therapy)
> Amiodarone, β-blockers or verapamil, Cardioverter defibrillator (for high sudden-death-risk patients per validated risk scores e.g. HCM Risk-SCD), Dual chamber pacemaker (for drug-refractory symptoms in selected patients), ± Endocarditis prophylaxis (for those with prior endocarditis or a prosthetic valve, not HOCM itself routinely)

- **Definitive:** septal reduction therapy (surgical myectomy or alcohol septal ablation) for drug-refractory outflow obstruction causing significant symptoms.
- **Chronic/long-term:** avoid competitive/intense exercise; family cascade screening (echo ± genetic testing) given autosomal dominant inheritance; regular specialist follow-up with periodic sudden-death risk restratification.

> [!danger] Drugs to avoid: nitrates, ACE inhibitors, inotropes (reduce preload/afterload and worsen dynamic outflow obstruction).

---

## 0.25 Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC)

**D:** Primary cardiomyopathy characterised by fibrofatty replacement of the right ventricular myocardium. Autosomal dominant.

**R:** family history; usually presents in late 20s (2nd most common cause of sudden cardiac death in the young, after HOCM); M>F (1.6x); intense exercise. Associated with Naxos disease (triad of ARVC, palmoplantar keratosis, woolly hair).

**A:** mutations in various genes; 50% of patients have mutations in genes encoding desmosome components.

**S/Smx:** palpitations, syncope, sudden cardiac death

**Ix:** ECG (*why:* screens for the RV-origin conduction/repolarisation abnormalities characteristic of the disease; *what:* ventricular arrhythmia with LBBB morphology (since it originates in the RV), T wave inversion in V1–V3, epsilon wave — a small deflection at the end of the QRS, essentially a "terminal notch"). Cardiac MRI (*why:* the best imaging modality for characterising RV structure/function and fibrofatty infiltration, often more sensitive than echo for this RV-predominant disease; *what:* RV dilation/dysfunction, regional wall motion abnormality, fibrofatty replacement on tissue characterisation). Genetic testing/family screening (*why:* confirms diagnosis and enables cascade screening of relatives given autosomal dominant inheritance; *what:* identifies a desmosomal gene mutation in ~50%). Holter monitor (*why:* documents ventricular arrhythmia burden, relevant to risk stratification; *what:* may show frequent PVCs of RV origin or NSVT).

**Mx:**
- **Immediate/acute:** manage any presenting ventricular arrhythmia/cardiac arrest per ALS algorithm (section 0.5).
- **Definitive:** sotalol first-line antiarrhythmic; catheter ablation for recurrent VT; ICD for those with high sudden-death risk (prior cardiac arrest, sustained VT, significant RV dysfunction, strong family history of sudden death).
- **Chronic/long-term:** avoid intense/competitive exercise (accelerates disease progression and arrhythmic risk); family cascade screening; regular cardiology follow-up.

---

## 0.26 Dilated Cardiomyopathy

**D:** Disease of heart muscle characterised by enlargement and dilation of one or both ventricles with impaired contractility. LVEF ≤40% and systolic dysfunction (by definition).

**Causes:** idiopathic; ischaemic heart disease and HTN; myocarditis (Coxsackie B virus, HIV, Chagas disease); peripartum; iatrogenic (e.g. doxorubicin); substance abuse (alcohol, cocaine); inherited (e.g. Duchenne muscular dystrophy); infiltrative (haemochromatosis, sarcoidosis); thiamine deficiency (wet beri beri)

**P:** myocardial remodelling → eccentric hypertrophy of ventricles → predominantly systolic dysfunction. Can lead to significant tricuspid and mitral valve insufficiency → ↓ejection fraction.

**S/Smx:** heart failure symptoms + S3. Tricuspid and mitral valve regurgitation cause pansystolic murmur.

**Ix:** CXR (*why:* screens for cardiomegaly and pulmonary congestion; *what:* classic "balloon appearance" of an enlarged globular heart). Others as per heart failure (section 0.27) — echo (*why:* confirms dilation and quantifies systolic dysfunction/EF, the key diagnostic test; *what:* dilated LV ± RV with reduced EF ≤40%), NTproBNP (*why:* supports the diagnosis and quantifies severity; *what:* elevated), bloods to screen for reversible/secondary causes — iron studies (haemochromatosis), TFT, HIV serology if risk factors, alcohol history — (*why:* identifying a treatable secondary cause changes management significantly; *what:* positive findings point to the specific cause), cardiac MRI (*why:* can identify myocarditis, infiltrative disease, or scar pattern distinguishing ischaemic from non-ischaemic aetiology; *what:* late gadolinium enhancement pattern specific to the cause).

**Mx:** as per chronic/acute heart failure (section 0.27), with additional attention to treating/removing the underlying cause where identified (e.g. alcohol cessation, iron chelation/venesection for haemochromatosis, immunosuppression for some myocarditis, stopping the causative chemotherapy agent) — this is the key Mx distinction from primary HFrEF, since some causes are reversible with cause-specific treatment on top of standard HF therapy.

---

## 0.27 Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy

**D:** "Octopus trap" — transient, apical ballooning of the myocardium brought about by stress.

**S/Smx:** chest pain, features of heart failure

**Ix:** ECG (*why:* mimics STEMI and must be worked up as such initially, since they cannot be distinguished clinically; *what:* ST elevation, indistinguishable from STEMI on ECG alone). Troponin (*why:* typically elevated (myocardial injury occurs) but classically out of proportion to the degree of LV dysfunction seen on imaging — helps raise suspicion once angiography is normal; *what:* mildly-moderately elevated). Coronary angiography (*why:* the key test to exclude ACS/confirm the diagnosis, since Takotsubo is a diagnosis of exclusion made after ruling out obstructive coronary disease; *what:* normal/non-obstructed coronary arteries despite the ECG/wall motion findings). Echo/ventriculography (*why:* confirms the characteristic wall motion pattern; *what:* apical ballooning with basal hyperkinesis — the "octopus trap" appearance).

**Mx:**
- **Immediate/acute:** managed initially as suspected ACS/STEMI until angiography excludes obstructive coronary disease (cannot be distinguished clinically or on ECG alone); supportive care for heart failure/shock if present (avoid inotropes if LVOT obstruction is present, as they can worsen it).
- **Definitive:** supportive — most patients recover LV function within weeks; no specific disease-modifying therapy is proven, though ACEI/β-blocker are often continued short-term as for HF.
- **Chronic/long-term:** identify and address the precipitating stressor if possible (often a major emotional or physical stress trigger); recurrence occurs in a minority — no specific long-term therapy is proven to prevent it.



## 0.28 Chronic Heart Failure

**D:** Dysfunction of the left ventricle resulting in insufficient delivery of blood to vital organs. Classified by ejection fraction: **HFrEF** (reduced, EF <40%), **HFmrEF** (mildly reduced, EF 40–49%) and **HFpEF** (preserved, EF ≥50%). The middle band matters — it is not a gap in the definitions, and those patients are managed closer to HFrEF than the older two-way split implied.

> [!info] NYHA classification
> I: symptoms do not affect daily activities
> II: symptoms occur at moderate effort, slightly restricting daily activities
> III: symptoms occur at minimal effort, significantly restricting daily activities
> IV: debilitating symptoms at rest

**R:** CAD, HTN, ↑cholesterol, DM, smoking, radiation, some chemotherapy, family history

**A/P:** HTN, CAD, ↑cholesterol → ↑peripheral vascular resistance → hypertrophy of heart to compensate → a stressor (volume overload, arrhythmia, MI) may cause decompensation. Main issue is during diastole — impaired relaxation and/or filling, impaired elasticity/compliance of myocardium.
- Systolic HF — impaired contraction
- Diastolic HF — impaired filling

**S/Smx:** dyspnoea, cough (pink/frothy) ± cardiac wheeze, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, weight loss (cardiac cachexia; may be masked by water gain), peripheral oedema (sacral, pedal), signs of right heart failure (↑JVP, ankle oedema, hepatomegaly)

**Ix:** NTproBNP (*why:* highly sensitive rule-out test for HF and quantifies severity; *what:* ≥400 ng/L = high, warranting urgent echo; low level makes HF unlikely). TTEcho within 2 weeks of a high NTproBNP (*why:* confirms the diagnosis, quantifies EF (HFpEF vs HFrEF), and identifies a structural cause (valvular, ischaemic); *what:* reduced EF in HFrEF, normal EF with diastolic dysfunction in HFpEF, chamber size/wall motion abnormalities). Other bloods — FBC (*why:* screens for anaemia as a reversible contributor/mimic; *what:* may show anaemia), U&Es (*why:* baseline renal function before ACEI/diuretic and to detect cardiorenal syndrome; *what:* may show renal impairment). CXR (*why:* supports the diagnosis and screens for alternative/co-existing pathology; *what:* bilateral pleural effusions, fluid in interlobar fissures, septal (Kerley B) lines, cardiomegaly). ECG (*why:* screens for an underlying cause — ischaemia, arrhythmia, LVH; *what:* may show prior infarct changes, AF, LVH, or be normal).

**Mx:**
- **Definitive/chronic (guideline-directed medical therapy, titrated over time — this condition doesn't have a separate "immediate" tier for stable chronic HF; see 0.27.1 for acute decompensation):**
  - ACEI + β-blocker (e.g. bisoprolol) — start one drug at a time
  - Aldosterone antagonist (e.g. eplerenone) — monitor renal function (risk of hyperkalaemia)
  - SGLT2 inhibitor
  - 3rd line (specialist-initiated): ivabradine (if sinus rhythm HR >75, LVEF <35%); sacubitril-valsartan (LVEF <35%, requires ACEI washout); digoxin (especially useful if coexisting AF); hydralazine and nitrate (an option where ACEI/ARB isn't tolerated, e.g. renal impairment); cardiac resynchronisation therapy
- **Chronic/long-term (adjuncts):** annual influenza vaccine, one-off pneumococcal vaccine, cardiac rehabilitation, fluid/salt restriction advice, daily weight monitoring for early decompensation detection.

### 0.28.1 Acute heart failure — Mx (Immediate/acute tier)
> [!tip] Mnemonic "Pour SOD"
> **P**our away fluids — fluid restriction
> **S**it them upright
> **O**xygen — target 94–98% sats; CPAP if respiratory failure
> **D**iuretics, e.g. IV furosemide

- In hypotension or cardiogenic shock: inotropic agents (e.g. dobutamine), vasopressors (e.g. noradrenaline), mechanical circulatory assistance (e.g. ventricular assist devices)
- Vasodilators — consider in concomitant myocardial ischaemia, severe hypertension, aortic regurgitation, or mitral regurgitation
- Opiates — not routinely offered
- Continue regular HF medications; stop β-blockers only if HR <50, 2nd/3rd degree AV block, or shock
- Once stabilised, transition back to the chronic guideline-directed therapy above.

### 0.28.2 High output heart failure
A normal heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's metabolic needs, e.g. severe anaemia, pregnancy, Paget's disease, thiamine deficiency. **Mx — definitive:** treat the underlying cause (e.g. transfusion/iron for anaemia, thiamine replacement for beriberi) rather than standard HFrEF therapy alone.

### 0.28.3 Cor pulmonale
Right heart failure arising from lung disease specifically — COPD, PE, interstitial lung disease, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary HTN. **Mx — definitive:** treat the underlying lung disease/pulmonary hypertension (see section 0.36) as the primary driver; long-term O2 therapy if hypoxic; diuretics for fluid overload as an adjunct.

### 0.28.4 Explaining a new heart failure diagnosis to a patient

> [!note] Targeted patient-facing addition — a plausible OSCE station given how common HF is and its significant lifestyle/prognostic implications. See [[Communication]] for the general framework.

- Plain-language explanation: "Your heart isn't pumping as effectively as it should, which means fluid can build up in your lungs and body — that's what's causing your breathlessness and swelling."
- Be honest but measured about prognosis — HF carries real mortality risk, but modern guideline-directed therapy substantially improves both symptoms and survival; avoid both false reassurance and undue alarm.
- Explain the medication regimen as a coordinated set working via different mechanisms (section 0.27) rather than an overwhelming list — patients often need to hear that the combination, built up gradually, is what improves outcomes, not any single drug.
- Cover practical self-management explicitly: daily weighing to catch early fluid retention, fluid/salt restriction, what symptoms should prompt urgent review (rapid weight gain, worsening breathlessness/orthopnoea, leg swelling).
- Address the emotional weight of a chronic, life-limiting diagnosis — check in on how the patient is feeling about it, not just what they understand factually.
- Discuss vaccination (influenza, pneumococcal — section 0.27) and cardiac rehabilitation/exercise as part of ongoing management, not just medication.
- Check understanding and invite questions before closing; involve family/carers if the patient wishes, given the ongoing self-monitoring burden.

## 0.29 Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)

**D:** Blood clot in a major deep vein, classically in the lower limbs, impairing venous blood flow.

**R:** ↑age, recent surgery, immobility >3 days, previous VTE, cancer, pregnancy, COCP, HRT, trauma, clotting disorder

**A/P:** Virchow's triad (stasis, endothelial damage, hypercoagulability). Can lead to PE if the clot embolises.

**S/Smx (Wells score-based):** risk factors as above; localised tenderness along venous distribution; entire leg swollen; calf swelling ≥3cm larger than other leg; pitting oedema of affected side; collateral superficial veins

**Ix & Mx based on Wells score:**

> [!info] Wells score ≥2 points
> (1) Proximal leg USS (*why:* directly visualises the thrombus, definitive diagnostic test; *what:* non-compressible vein confirms DVT) within 4h, OR (2) D-dimer (*why:* rules out DVT if negative given high sensitivity, used when scan isn't immediately available; *what:* elevated is non-specific but supports the diagnosis pending scan) + anticoagulate + scan within 24h
> - Scan +ve → DVT, anticoagulate
> - Scan −ve → D-dimer + anticoagulate
> - D-dimer +ve but scan −ve → stop anticoagulating, repeat scan in 1 week
> - D-dimer −ve and scan −ve → stop anticoagulating, consider alternative diagnosis
> - 2nd scan +ve → DVT, anticoagulate; 2nd scan −ve → alternative diagnosis

> [!info] Wells score ≤1 point
> (1) D-dimer with result within 4h, OR (2) D-dimer + interim anticoagulation
> - D-dimer −ve → stop anticoagulating, consider alternative diagnosis
> - D-dimer +ve → treat as per Wells ≥2

**Mx:**
- **Immediate/acute:** interim anticoagulation while awaiting confirmatory imaging where indicated by the Wells pathway above (see boxes).
- **Definitive (anticoagulation once confirmed):**
  - DOAC (apixaban, rivaroxaban), or LMWH followed by dabigatran/edoxaban, or LMWH followed by warfarin
  - Special situations: cancer — still use DOAC; renal impairment — LMWH → warfarin; antiphospholipid syndrome (especially triple +ve) — LMWH → warfarin
- **Chronic/long-term:** duration — provoked — 3 months; provoked by cancer — 3–6 months depending on continued risk; unprovoked — 6 months + investigate for underlying cause (e.g. CT-TAP for cancer). Graduated compression stockings can help post-thrombotic syndrome symptoms once anticoagulation is established (not for acute clot itself). Review for long-term anticoagulation vs finite course based on recurrence risk and bleeding risk at the end of the initial treatment course.

> [!info] Verified against Australian Prescriber, Aug 2026 — this is not UK-specific guidance; the same risk-stratified approach is standard Australian practice, no change needed.
> Long-haul flights (>4h): slight increased risk, most pronounced for symptomless DVT rather than clinically significant VTE. If no major VTE risk factors, no special measures required beyond general advice (mobilisation, hydration, calf exercises). If other risk factors present: graduated compression stockings (evidence strongest for reducing asymptomatic DVT) ± consider LMWH for higher-risk patients on individual assessment. No proven role for aspirin.

---

## 0.30 Pulmonary Embolism (PE)

**D:** Occlusion in the pulmonary vasculature due to thrombus arising in or travelling to the lungs, most often from a deep vein.

**R:** as per DVT

**A/P:** most often a DVT that breaks off and lodges in the lungs.

**S/Smx (Wells score-based):** risk factors as for DVT; clinical signs of DVT; HR >100; haemoptysis; ↑RR (>20); crackles; fever; pleuritic chest pain

**Other Ix while awaiting results:**
- ECG (*why:* screens for RV strain patterns and helps exclude other causes of chest pain, though usually non-diagnostic for PE itself; *what:* most commonly sinus tachycardia; S1Q3T3 in only 20%; RBBB and RAD may be associated)
- CXR for all patients (*why:* mainly to exclude alternative diagnoses (pneumonia, pneumothorax) since it's usually normal in PE; *what:* usually normal unless large PE (wedge-shaped opacification, i.e. Hampton's hump))
- ABG (*why:* may show hypoxia and a widened A-a gradient supporting the diagnosis, and guides O2 therapy; *what:* often shows hypoxia with respiratory alkalosis (hyperventilation)), FBC including clotting screen (*why:* baseline before anticoagulation; *what:* baseline platelet count/coags)

> [!info] PERC rule — all criteria must be ABSENT to give <2% probability of PE (otherwise proceed to Wells score)
> ≥50yo, HR ≥100, O2 sats ≤94%, previous DVT/PE, recent surgery/trauma in past 4 weeks, haemoptysis, unilateral leg swelling, oestrogen use

**Ix & Mx based on Wells score:**

> [!info] Wells score ≥4 points
> (1) Immediate CTPA (*why:* definitive diagnostic test, directly visualises the pulmonary vasculature; *what:* filling defect in the pulmonary arteries confirms PE), OR (2) interim DOAC while awaiting CTPA
> - CTPA +ve → PE, anticoagulate
> - CTPA −ve → consider proximal leg vein USS if DVT suspected
> - CTPA contraindicated (e.g. pregnant, renal impairment) → use V/Q scan (*why:* avoids contrast/radiation dose concerns of CTPA in these groups; *what:* mismatched perfusion defect with normal ventilation supports PE)

> [!info] Wells score <4 points
> (1) D-dimer test
> - D-dimer +ve → treat as per Wells ≥4
> - D-dimer −ve → stop anticoagulation, consider alternative diagnosis

**Mx:**
- **Immediate/acute:** if massive PE with circulatory failure (hypotension/shock) → systemic thrombolysis (or catheter-directed thrombolysis/embolectomy if thrombolysis contraindicated); O2, resuscitation as needed.
- **Definitive:** anticoagulation as per DVT (same drug options/special situations).
- **Chronic/long-term:** duration as per DVT; Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) used to determine suitability for outpatient treatment (accounts for haemodynamic stability, comorbidities, etc.); IVC filter considered for recurrent PE despite adequate anticoagulation, or when anticoagulation is contraindicated; screen for and manage chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH — see section 0.36) if symptoms persist post-PE.

---

## 0.31 Infective Endocarditis

**D:** Infection involving the endocardial surface of the heart, including valvular structures.

**R:** prior history of IE, prosthetic heart valves, congenital heart disease, heart transplant, sources of bacteraemia (vascular catheter, recent dental work, IVDU)

**A:** *Strep. viridans*, *S. aureus*, *Strep. bovis*, Enterococci; culture-negative — HACEK organisms

> [!note] HACEK = Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter (previously Actinobacillus), Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, Kingella. Most common culture-negative causes include fastidious organisms (zoonotic agents, fungi) and Strep in patients who have received prior antibiotics.

**P:** thrombi develop on valvular surfaces due to increased endothelial damage, acting as foci for bacterial colonisation and growth.

**S/Smx:** fever, murmur, constitutional symptoms, weakness, arthralgia, headache, dyspnoea. Janeway lesions, Osler's nodes, Roth spots, splinter haemorrhages.

**Ix:** blood cultures, 3x 10 mL from different sites at 30-min intervals (*why:* isolates the causative organism and confirms persistent bacteraemia — a Duke criterion — before antibiotics alter culture yield; *what:* positive cultures, typically the organisms listed above). Echo — TTE first-line, TOE if TTE non-diagnostic or higher suspicion (*why:* directly visualises vegetations and assesses valvular damage/complications, the other major Duke criterion; *what:* vegetation, new valvular regurgitation, or abscess). FBC (*why:* screens for the inflammatory/anaemic picture of chronic infection; *what:* normocytic anaemia, leucocytosis). CRP (*why:* supports the inflammatory diagnosis and can be trended to monitor treatment response; *what:* elevated). U&E (*why:* baseline renal function, and screens for immune-complex glomerulonephritis, a recognised IE complication; *what:* may show renal impairment). LFT (*why:* baseline before prolonged antibiotic therapy; *what:* usually normal). Urinalysis (*why:* screens for microscopic haematuria from immune-complex glomerulonephritis or renal emboli; *what:* may show haematuria). ECG (*why:* screens for new conduction abnormality suggesting perivalvular/aortic root abscess extension, an indication for surgery; *what:* new prolonged PR interval or heart block).

> [!note] Gap-filled — "Duke criterion" was referenced twice by name above (blood cultures, echo) without ever laying out the actual structured framework these feed into.

**Modified Duke criteria — the formal diagnostic classification:**
- **Major criteria:** (1) positive blood cultures for a typical IE organism from ≥2 separate cultures, or persistently positive cultures; (2) evidence of endocardial involvement — a positive echo (vegetation, abscess, new partial dehiscence of a prosthetic valve) or new valvular regurgitation.
- **Minor criteria:** predisposing heart condition or IVDU; fever ≥38°C; vascular phenomena (arterial emboli, septic pulmonary infarcts, mycotic aneurysm, intracranial haemorrhage, Janeway lesions); immunologic phenomena (glomerulonephritis, Osler's nodes, Roth spots, positive rheumatoid factor); microbiological evidence not meeting the major criterion (e.g. a single positive culture, or serological evidence of an organism consistent with IE).
- **Classification:** **definite IE** = 2 major, or 1 major + 3 minor, or 5 minor criteria; **possible IE** = 1 major + 1 minor, or 3 minor criteria; **rejected** = firm alternative diagnosis, resolution with ≤4 days of antibiotics, or criteria for possible/definite IE not met.
- **Practical point:** the criteria are a structured diagnostic aid, not a substitute for clinical judgement — a patient can be treated as IE on strong clinical suspicion even if formal criteria aren't yet fully met (e.g. while awaiting culture results), particularly if the patient is unwell.

**Mx:**
- **Immediate/acute:** sepsis pathway if haemodynamically unstable; empirical broad-spectrum IV antibiotics after cultures are drawn (don't delay for culture results if the patient is unwell), then rationalise once organism/sensitivities known.
- **Definitive:** prolonged (typically 4–6 week) targeted IV antibiotic course once organism identified; urgent surgery if indicated (see box below) — timing is a balance between infection control and surgical risk.

> [!warning] Indications for surgery in IE
> Severe valvular incompetence; aortic abscess (↑PR interval); infections resistant to antibiotics (e.g. fungal); HF refractory to medical treatment; recurrent emboli after antibiotics

- **Chronic/long-term:** dental hygiene education and endocarditis-prophylaxis antibiotics before high-risk dental procedures in the specific patient groups where this is recommended (prior IE, prosthetic valve, some congenital heart disease) — not for the general population; regular follow-up echo after treatment completion, especially with prosthetic material.

**P:** increased mortality if elderly and resulting in HF. Possible cerebral complications. Surgery associated with reduced mortality.

---

## 0.32 Pericarditis

**D:** Inflammation of the pericardium. Acute = lasting ≤6 weeks. Fibrinous vs effusive.

**R:** M>F, 20–50yo, STEMI, cardiac surgery, cancer, infection (especially viral), uraemia, dialysis, autoimmune disease

**A:** 90% idiopathic or viral infection; 10% other — infectious, autoimmune, secondary immune, heart-related, metabolic, traumatic, neoplastic, drug-related, idiopathic

**P:** inflammation may lead to effusion or fibrosis.

**S/Smx:** chest pain (acute, sharp, pleuritic/stabbing; relieved by sitting forward; may mimic MI but not relieved by GTN), pericardial rub (<33%), fever, myalgia

> [!info] Gap-filled — "relieved by sitting forward" was stated as a positional fact without explaining the mechanism, despite being a genuinely useful discriminator from MI (which lacks this positional variation). **Mechanism:** in the inflamed pericardium, the visceral and parietal pericardial layers become roughened and irritate each other with each heartbeat (the same friction producing the pericardial rub above) — **lying flat allows the heart to fall backward, increasing contact and pressure between the inflamed posterior pericardial surfaces and the adjacent diaphragmatic pleura**, worsening the mechanical irritation and pain. **Sitting forward allows the heart to fall away from the posterior pericardium**, reducing this contact and the resulting friction, which is why the position genuinely eases the pain rather than simply being a coincidental patient preference. This positional variation, alongside the pleuritic quality and lack of response to GTN, is precisely what helps distinguish pericarditis from myocardial infarction at the bedside, given both can otherwise present with similar acute chest pain.

**Clinical diagnosis confirmed by 2 of 4:** characteristic chest pain, pericardial friction rub, ECG change, new/worsening pericardial effusion.

> [!warning] Always exclude PE.

**Ix:** ECG (*why:* supports the clinical diagnosis (one of the 4 diagnostic criteria) and distinguishes from STEMI; *what:* widespread/global ST elevation and/or PR depression, unlike the territorial ST elevation of STEMI). TTEcho (*why:* screens for pericardial effusion (another diagnostic criterion) and its haemodynamic significance/tamponade risk; *what:* may show effusion, normal in many cases). Bloods — FBC, CRP/ESR (*why:* supports an inflammatory process and can be trended; *what:* elevated inflammatory markers), troponin (*why:* screens for concurrent myocarditis (myopericarditis) and helps exclude MI; *what:* may be mildly elevated if myocardial involvement, though a rising/falling pattern would suggest MI instead). Pericardiocentesis (*why:* reserved for large/tamponading effusions, both therapeutic and diagnostic — identifies the causative organism/malignant cells if unclear; *what:* fluid analysis per suspected cause). CXR (*why:* screens for a large effusion (globular "water bottle" heart) and excludes other chest pain causes; *what:* may show an enlarged cardiac silhouette if large effusion, or be normal).

**Mx:**
- **Immediate/acute:** suspected cardiac tamponade → urgent pericardiocentesis (see section 0.33).
- **Definitive:** NSAID + colchicine (combination reduces recurrence risk compared to either alone) + PPI cover; treat underlying cause if present — most cases are viral/idiopathic with no specific antiviral treatment; if bacterial (purulent), IV antibiotics.
- **Chronic/long-term:** advise avoiding strenuous activity until symptoms resolve and inflammatory markers normalise (typically weeks); colchicine course is typically continued for ~3 months to reduce recurrence; recurrent pericarditis may need longer colchicine courses or, rarely, immunosuppression/pericardiectomy for refractory recurrent disease.

**P:** poorer outcome if large effusion, high fever, subacute course, or failure to respond.

> [!note] Pericardial rub — "fresh snow" sound, best heard at the left sternal edge, leaning forward, end-expiration. Heard even when holding breath (not respiration-related). May need repeat examination.

### Added from unverified layer — myopericarditis, and why it changes the advice
`SRC:B1_Chest_Pain_Framework_and_Cardiac_Biomarkers §0.3` `UNVERIFIED — model knowledge, not source-checked. Duration of exercise restriction, per CSANZ or Heart Foundation.`

> [!danger] A raised troponin in apparent pericarditis reclassifies the illness
> Suspect **myocarditis** where **troponin is raised, ventricular function is impaired, or arrhythmia occurs.** That turns a self-limiting nuisance into a potentially serious disease, and it changes what the patient is told.
> **Exercise restriction matters here in a way it does not in uncomplicated pericarditis**, because **exertion during active myocarditis is associated with arrhythmic death**. The Mx – Chronic advice above ("avoid strenuous activity until symptoms resolve and inflammatory markers normalise") is the pericarditis version; myocarditis needs a defined period of restriction, and this is advice **young athletic patients most need and least often receive.** `UNVERIFIED — the duration, per CSANZ or Heart Foundation.`
>
> **Myocarditis has no entry of its own anywhere in this vault.** It appears twenty-seven times, every one of them as a complication of something else — diphtheria, clozapine, Chagas disease, measles, Lyme disease, dilated cardiomyopathy. This block is the closest thing to a standing entry and is not a substitute for one.

**Uraemic pericarditis:** treat with intensive dialysis.

**Dressler's syndrome:** post-MI pericarditis (possible inflammatory reaction), usually 2–4 weeks post-MI; Mx as per pericarditis.

---

## 0.33 Constrictive Pericarditis

**D:** A form of diastolic heart failure arising because an inelastic pericardium inhibits cardiac filling.

**A:** similar causes to acute pericarditis; most common cause is TB. Can also occur following heart surgery or mediastinal radiation (M>F 3:1).

**P:** during healing, granulation tissue forms; may contract over time ± calcify → constrictive picture.

**S/Smx:** dyspnoea; right heart failure (↑JVP, ascites, oedema, hepatomegaly); JVP with prominent x and y descent; pericardial knock (loud S3); Kussmaul's sign positive (paradoxical rise in JVP during inspiration)

**Ix:** as per acute pericarditis (ECG, echo, bloods) — *why/what as above*, plus: CXR (*why:* screens for the characteristic chronic finding; *what:* may show pericardial calcification). Cardiac MRI or CT (*why:* better delineates pericardial thickening/calcification than echo and helps distinguish from restrictive cardiomyopathy — see section 0.41 for that key differential; *what:* thickened/calcified pericardium). Cardiac catheterisation (*why:* used when imaging is equivocal to confirm the haemodynamic pattern and distinguish from restrictive cardiomyopathy; *what:* equalisation of diastolic pressures across chambers, "dip-and-plateau" (square root sign) pattern).

**Mx:**
- **Immediate/acute:** manage decompensated right heart failure symptoms (diuretics) while working up definitive treatment.
- **Definitive:** surgical pericardiectomy is the only effective treatment for established chronic constrictive pericarditis.
- **Chronic/long-term:** if the inflammatory process is still active/early (rather than established fibrocalcific constriction), a trial of anti-inflammatory therapy (NSAIDs or other) may be tried before committing to surgery; treat the underlying cause where identifiable (e.g. anti-TB therapy).

## 0.34 Cardiac Tamponade

**D:** Accumulation of pericardial fluid, blood, pus, or air within the pericardial space.

> [!danger] Medical emergency.

**R:** malignancy (especially lung and breast), aortic dissection, purulent pericarditis, heart surgery, TB

**A:** iatrogenic (e.g. surgery), trauma, malignancy, idiopathic

**P:** ↑pericardial pressure secondary to fluid accumulation → if pericardial pressure exceeds intra-chamber pressures, the heart collapses.

**S/Smx:**
- **Beck's triad** — hypotension, ↑JVP, muffled heart sounds
- Dyspnoea, ↑HR, pulsus paradoxus, ± Kussmaul's sign
- Pulsus paradoxus: marked drop in BP on inspiration
- Kussmaul's sign: paradoxical rise in right atrial pressure on inspiration
- Electrical alternans: QRS complex amplitude changes in alternate cycles

> [!info] The mechanism tying these findings together — worth understanding as one connected picture, not four isolated facts, given they all trace back to the same compression physiology already noted above (P:). **Beck's triad**: the raised pericardial pressure directly restricts diastolic filling — hypotension follows from reduced stroke volume/cardiac output; ↑JVP reflects blood backing up against a heart that can't fill properly; muffled heart sounds result from the fluid itself dampening the sounds' transmission through to the chest wall. **Pulsus paradoxus**: normally, inspiration modestly increases venous return to the right heart and modestly reduces left heart filling — in tamponade, the pericardium is already so tightly stretched around a fixed total volume that this normal inspiratory increase in right-heart filling can only occur by the interventricular septum bulging *into* the already-compromised left ventricle, further reducing left ventricular filling and stroke volume — producing an exaggerated (≥10mmHg) fall in systolic BP with inspiration, rather than the trivial fall (usually <10mmHg) seen normally. **Kussmaul's sign**: the paradoxical *rise* in JVP with inspiration reflects the same fixed-volume pericardial constraint — normally inspiration lowers intrathoracic pressure and draws blood into the right atrium, dropping JVP, but a tamponade-restricted heart can't accommodate this extra venous return, so pressure backs up into the neck veins instead of falling.

**Ix:** ECG (*why:* screens for the associated electrical finding and helps exclude other causes; *what:* electrical alternans — QRS amplitude alternating beat-to-beat as the heart swings within the effusion; low voltage may also be seen). TTE (*why:* the key bedside diagnostic test — directly visualises the effusion and its haemodynamic significance; *what:* pericardial effusion with diastolic collapse of the right atrium/ventricle — the echo correlate of tamponade physiology). CXR (*why:* screens for a large effusion and alternative diagnoses; *what:* enlarged "globular" cardiac silhouette if effusion is large, though may be normal in acute rapid accumulation). Bloods — FBC, cardiac enzymes (*why:* screens for an infective/malignant/ischaemic cause and baseline before intervention; *what:* may be normal or reflect the underlying cause).

**Mx:**
- **Immediate/acute:** urgent pericardiocentesis if unstable (needle inserted into pericardial sac, ideally echo-guided, to drain fluid) — this is the emergency life-saving intervention; ABCDE support, IV fluids as a temporising measure (increases preload, doesn't fix the underlying problem).
- **Definitive:** treat the underlying cause once stabilised (e.g. drainage + antibiotics for purulent pericarditis, oncological management for malignant effusion); pericardial window (surgical) for recurrent/loculated effusions not amenable to repeat needle drainage.
- **Chronic/long-term:** surveillance echo for recurrence risk depending on cause (e.g. malignant effusions often recur).

## 0.35 Cardiology Drugs

> [!info] Verified against AMH/eTG, Aug 2026 — see per-subsection notes below. Drug classes, mechanisms, monitoring schedules, and dosing in this section are consistent with Australian prescribing practice; no material UK-vs-AU differences were found beyond the two flagged uncertainties below (perioperative aspirin timing; and this section hasn't been checked for brand/PBS-availability differences, which don't affect clinical content).

### 0.35.1 Antihypertensives — detailed profiles

> [!info] Verified against AMH, Aug 2026 — drug classes, mechanisms, and adverse-effect profiles below are pharmacologically universal (not UK-specific); no changes needed to this subsection. Drug names/classes used (ACEI, ARB, β-blocker, CCB, thiazide/thiazide-like, loop, aldosterone antagonist, α-blocker) are all standard AMH/eTG choices in Australian practice.

**ACE inhibitors (-pril):**
- Adverse effects: dry cough in 15% (secondary to ↑bradykinin), angioedema (may occur up to a year after starting), hyperkalaemia, first-dose orthostatic hypotension
- Contraindicated/caution: pregnancy and breastfeeding (teratogenic), renovascular disease (especially renal artery stenosis), aortic stenosis (may cause hypotension), hereditary idiopathic angioedema
- Monitoring: U&Es — can cause transient ↑SCr up to 30% from baseline, transient ↑K up to 5.5 mmol/L; consider undiagnosed bilateral renal artery stenosis if renal impairment occurs

**Angiotensin II blockers/ARBs (-sartan):** generally used where ACEIs not tolerated; similar contraindications/cautions to ACEIs

**β-blockers (-olol):**
- Adverse effects: bronchospasm, cold peripheries, fatigue, sleep disturbances, erectile dysfunction
- Contraindications/cautions: uncontrolled HF, asthma (bronchospasm), sick sinus syndrome, concurrent verapamil use (may precipitate severe bradycardia)

**Calcium channel blockers:**
- Non-dihydropyridine: verapamil (HF, constipation, hypotension, bradycardia, flushing — do NOT give with β-blockers) and diltiazem (HF, hypotension, bradycardia, ankle swelling)
- Dihydropyridine (e.g. amlodipine, nifedipine): affect peripheral vascular smooth muscle more than the heart; do not worsen HF but can cause ankle swelling; adverse effects — flushing, headache, ankle swelling; nifedipine can be used in pregnancy

**Thiazide diuretics (e.g. indapamide, chlortalidone):**
- MOA: inhibit sodium reabsorption in kidneys (can result in ↑K loss)
- Adverse effects: dehydration, orthostatic hypotension, ↓K, ↓Na, ↑Ca (and hypocalciuria), gout, impaired glucose tolerance, impotence; rarely pancreatitis

**Loop diuretics (e.g. furosemide, bumetanide):**
- MOA: inhibit NaCl reabsorption by inhibiting the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter
- Poor renal function may require much higher doses to reach adequate tubular concentration
- Adverse effects: hypotension, ↓Na, ↓K, ↓Mg, ↓Ca, hypochloraemic alkalosis, ototoxicity, renal impairment, hyperglycaemia, gout

**Aldosterone antagonists (e.g. spironolactone, eplerenone):** "potassium-sparing diuretics"; MOA — ↓Na absorption in collecting ducts; adverse effects — ↑K, gynaecomastia (less common with eplerenone)

**α-blockers (e.g. doxazosin, tamsulosin):** not commonly used for HTN; adverse effects — orthostatic hypotension, drowsiness, dyspnoea, cough. Methyldopa used to control BP in pregnancy.

### 0.35.2 Amiodarone
- MOA: blocks K± Na channels; very long half-life (20–100 days)

> [!danger] Administer via central veins due to risk of thrombophlebitis; requires a loading dose.

- Monitoring: prior to treatment — TFT, LFT, CXR; every 6 months — TFT, LFT

> [!info] Verified — amiodarone's 6-monthly TFT/LFT monitoring schedule is consistent across UK, US (ACC/AHA/HRS), and Australian sources (it follows the drug's pharmacology, not a jurisdiction-specific protocol); no change needed. AMH doses/route are the same class of guidance as above.

- Adverse effects: thyroid dysfunction (both hyper- and hypo-), corneal deposits, pulmonary fibrosis/pneumonitis, liver fibrosis/hepatitis, peripheral neuropathy, myopathy, photosensitivity, 'slate-grey' skin discolouration, thrombophlebitis/injection site reactions, bradycardia, lengthens QT interval

### 0.35.3 Adenosine
- MOA: causes transient heart block in the AV node; α1 agonist at the AV node; half-life 8–10s; used to terminate SVT
- Avoid in asthmatics (possible bronchospasm)
- Adverse effects: chest pain, bronchospasm, transient flushing, ↑ventricular rate

> [!info] Verified — dosing (6mg → 12mg → 12mg) is the same internationally, including Australian ED/eTG practice; no change needed beyond the correction already made in section 0.9.1 above (some older sources cite an 18mg third dose; current standard is 12mg).

> [!warning] Administer via large-bore cannula due to short half-life.

### 0.35.4 Antiplatelets

| Indication | 1st line | 2nd line |
|---|---|---|
| ACS or PCI | Aspirin (lifelong) + ticagrelor (12mo) | Clopidogrel (lifelong) |
| TIA or stroke | Clopidogrel (lifelong) | Aspirin (lifelong) + dipyridamole (lifelong) |
| PAD | Clopidogrel (lifelong) | Aspirin (lifelong) |

> [!info] Verified — 12-month DAPT duration post-ACS/PCI is standard in Australian cardiac society guidance as well as international (ESC/ACC) guidelines; no change needed to the table above.

**Aspirin:** MOA — irreversible COX1/2 inhibitor. Do not use in <16yo (risk of Reye's syndrome, except in Kawasaki disease). Continue aspirin through CABG.

> [!info] Verified against ANZCA/2022 CHEST guideline evidence (cross-referenced from [[03a_Anaesthetics_Primer]] Pre-op instructions, where this was independently researched) — resolving the earlier open flag here: current evidence-based perioperative practice increasingly favours **continuing** aspirin through elective non-cardiac surgery by default, rather than a fixed pre-op cessation window. This is a genuine shift from the older British Society for Haematology-style "stop 3 days before" advice — the low bleeding-risk increment from continuing aspirin is generally judged not to outweigh the thrombotic risk of stopping it, for most elective non-cardiac procedures. High-bleeding-risk procedures (e.g. neurosurgery, some ophthalmic surgery) remain an exception where surgeon/anaesthetist-specific guidance should be followed. See [[03a_Anaesthetics_Primer]] Pre-op instructions for the fuller perioperative antiplatelet/anticoagulant picture (DOACs, warfarin, P2Y12 inhibitors) — not repeated here to avoid the two files drifting out of sync again.

**Clopidogrel, ticagrelor, prasugrel:** MOA — P2Y12 ADP receptor inhibitor. May be less effective with PPIs — lansoprazole may be the preferred PPI to co-prescribe.

### 0.35.5 Austroads cardiovascular driving rules (private vehicle standards)

> [!info] Verified against Austroads *Assessing Fitness to Drive* 2022 edition (current at Aug 2026), private-vehicle standards. Commercial-vehicle standards are stricter/longer and generally require annual specialist review — check the source document if advising a commercial driver. All periods below are minimum non-driving periods; a conditional licence beyond that requires satisfactory response to treatment and minimal symptoms (chest pain, palpitations, breathlessness) relevant to driving, per the treating doctor/specialist.
> - **AMI:** ≥2 weeks off driving (uncomplicated)
> - **Angina:** no fixed off-driving period — may drive without restriction if angina is usually absent on mild exertion and treatment-compliant; must not drive if angina occurs at rest/minimal exertion or is unstable
> - **PCI (elective):** ≥2 days off driving
> - **CABG:** ≥4 weeks off driving
> - **Atrial fibrillation:** ≥1 week off driving after successful ablation or after starting effective medical treatment (longer after open chest surgery)
> - **Paroxysmal arrhythmias (SVT, atrial flutter, idiopathic VT):** no fixed private-vehicle off-driving period unless there was near/definite collapse — then treat per treating doctor's advice
> - **Cardiac arrest:** ≥6 months off driving (may be shortened with specialist assessment if arrest was within 48h of an AMI, or cause was addressed by ablation/pacemaker)
> - **Pacemaker insertion:** ≥2 weeks off driving
> - **ICD:** if implanted after cardiac arrest (secondary prevention) — asymptomatic for 6 months; if prophylactic (primary prevention) — ≥2 weeks off driving; ≥2 weeks after a generator change; ≥4 weeks after an appropriate shock with haemodynamic compromise
> - **Aortic aneurysm (thoracic/abdominal):** ≥4 weeks off driving after repair; unrepaired aneurysm — conditional licence possible if <55mm (atherosclerotic/bicuspid-valve-associated) or <50mm (other causes)
> - **Valvular heart disease:** ≥4 weeks off driving following valve repair
> - **Heart transplant:** ≥6 weeks off driving
> - **Hypertension:** no fixed off-driving period; unconditional licence not held if BP is consistently >200 systolic or >110 diastolic (treated or untreated) — note this is a materially higher threshold than the UK's "no driving if treatment causes unacceptable side-effects" framing
> - **Syncope (cardiovascular cause, non-vasovagal):** ≥4 weeks off driving
> - **DVT/PE:** no specific licensing criteria — advisory non-driving period only, per treating doctor

## 0.36 Vascular Surgery

### 0.36.1 Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD)

**D:** Arterial disease caused by atherosclerotic obstruction of arteries outside the heart and brain. Divided into intermittent claudication, critical limb ischaemia, and acute limb-threatening ischaemia.

**R:** smoking, DM, HTN, ↑cholesterol, >40yo, history of CAD/stroke/TIA

**A/P:** atherosclerosis — fat deposits clog peripheral arteries.

**S/Smx:**
- **Intermittent claudication:** aching/burning in leg muscles during or after walking; predictable distance before symptoms start, relieved on stopping; no pain at rest
- **Critical limb ischaemia:** rest pain in the foot for ≥2 weeks, ulceration and/or gangrene
- **Acute limb-threatening ischaemia:**

> [!danger] The "P's" of acute limb ischaemia
> Pale, Pulseless, Painful, Paralysed, Paraesthetic (numb/sensory changes), Perishingly cold

**Ix:** leg pulses ± hand-held Doppler exam (*why:* first-line bedside screen for reduced/absent flow; *what:* diminished or absent pulses distally), ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) (*why:* quantifies severity and is the standard screening/diagnostic test; *what:* see interpretation in section 0.35.2), duplex USS (*why:* localises and characterises the stenosis/occlusion non-invasively; *what:* identifies site and severity of arterial narrowing), MRI/CT angiography (*why:* used for definitive anatomical mapping before intervention; *what:* defines the lesion for surgical/endovascular planning), ECG (*why:* screens for concurrent cardiac disease given shared atherosclerotic risk factors; *what:* may show evidence of prior MI/ischaemia).

**Mx:**
- **Immediate/acute** (severe/limb-threatening PAD — acute limb ischaemia): ABCDE + analgesia (e.g. IV opioids), IV UFH to prevent thrombus enlargement, urgent vascular review.
- **Definitive:** angioplasty ± stent; endovascular intervention for short-segment stenosis, aortoiliac disease, high-risk patients; open surgical revascularisation for long-segment lesions (>10cm), multifocal lesions, common femoral artery lesions, purely infrapopliteal disease; amputation as worst-case option for non-salvageable limb ischaemia.
- **Chronic/long-term:** stop smoking, manage comorbidities (DM, HTN); statin (atorvastatin 80mg) + clopidogrel for all patients regardless of intervention + analgesia for claudication; supervised exercise training programme (proven to improve walking distance).

### 0.36.2 Ankle-Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI)
Ratio of systolic BP in the lower leg to that in the arms (in diabetics, may need toe-brachial pressure index — TBPI, instead).
- \>1.2 — calcified, stiff arteries
- 0.9–1.2 — normal/acceptable
- <0.9 — likely PAD (do not apply compression banding)
- <0.5 — severe disease

### 0.36.3 Leriche Syndrome
**D:** Atheromatous disease of the iliac vessels → decreased blood flow to pelvic viscera (possible subtype of PAD).
**S/Smx (triad):** buttock claudication, impotence, no femoral pulses
**Ix:** angiography (*why:* definitive test for iliac occlusive disease and needed for endovascular planning; *what:* confirms bilateral iliac occlusion/severe stenosis)
**Mx:**
- **Definitive:** endovascular angioplasty and stent insertion (first-line given the favourable anatomy of aortoiliac disease for endovascular approach); open surgical bypass (aortobifemoral) reserved for extensive disease not amenable to endovascular repair.
- **Chronic/long-term:** as per PAD generally (risk factor modification, antiplatelet, statin).

### 0.36.4 Aortic Aneurysm

**D:** Permanent pathological dilation of the aorta — 1.5x expected AP diameter for the segment given the patient's sex and body size; >3cm. 90% occur below the renal arteries.

**R:** smoking, family history, ↑age, M>F incidence (but F>M rupture risk), connective tissue disorders; also hyperlipidaemia, HTN, atherosclerosis

**A/P:** degradation of aortic wall connective tissue by enzymes, inflammatory/immune response, wall stress, and genetics

**S/Smx:** most asymptomatic, picked up on screening; palpable pulsatile mass. If ruptured: shock, loss of consciousness, pain.

**Ix:** aortic USS (*why:* first-line screening/surveillance test, quick and radiation-free; *what:* measures aortic diameter), contrast CTA (*why:* used for definitive surgical/endovascular planning once intervention is being considered; *what:* precise diameter, extent, and anatomical relations for planning), bloods — group & save, X-match, clotting, FBC (*why:* prepares for possible transfusion/surgery, especially urgent in suspected rupture; *what:* baseline for surgical planning, or evidence of blood loss if ruptured).

**Mx:**
- **Immediate/acute (ruptured):** ABCDE resuscitation with permissive/controlled hypotension (avoid aggressive fluid resuscitation before haemorrhage control, to avoid "popping the clot"), urgent vascular surgical repair (open or endovascular aneurysm repair via femoral artery stent).
- **Definitive (unruptured, meeting intervention criteria):** stable but ≥5.5cm, or >4cm and growing >1cm/year → urgent referral to vascular surgery for elective repair (open or endovascular).
- **Chronic/long-term:** stop smoking; manage cardiovascular risk factors (statin, BP control) to slow growth; surveillance imaging (USS) for those not yet meeting intervention criteria, at an interval scaled to aneurysm size (see box below).

> [!info] Verified (RACGP AJGP, vascular surgery literature), Aug 2026 — Australia has **no organised national call-recall AAA screening programme** equivalent to the NHS one at 65yo. Opportunistic/selective screening (single USS) is reasonable for men 65–75yo, especially ever-smokers, on vascular society advice, but this is not a funded national program the way the NHS one is.
> [!info] Verified against RACGP AJGP (Austin Health, Melbourne — "Updates on AAA screening and surveillance"), Aug 2026 — Australian practice follows the SVS/ESVS-style surveillance intervals, which are stretched out more than the UK figures previously used here.
> **Australian surveillance intervals (by diameter, ultrasound preferred over CT for surveillance given no radiation/lower cost):** 3.0–3.9cm → 3-yearly; 4.0–4.9cm → annual; 5.0–5.4cm → 6-monthly. Referral to vascular surgery once the aneurysm reaches 5.0cm in men or 4.5cm in women (allows time to optimise comorbidities before the ~5.5cm repair threshold — see intervention criteria above).

**P:** high morbidity from rupture; increased morbidity/mortality associated with surgical intervention, though low complication risk if patient survives the intervention.

### 0.36.5 Aortic Dissection

**D:** A separation occurring in the aortic wall intima, causing blood flow into a new false channel composed of the inner and outer layers of the media.

**R:** aneurysms, Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, bicuspid aortic valve, coarctation, smoking, family history, HTN

**A/P:** intimal tear extends into the media of the aortic wall → blood passes through the media (antero- or retrograde), creating a false lumen → can occlude branches of the aorta

> [!info] Classification systems
> **Stanford:** Type A — ascending aorta, proximal to left subclavian artery. Type B — distal to left subclavian artery.
> **DeBakey:** I = A+B; II = A only; III = B only.

**S/Smx:** abrupt severe chest pain, abdominal pain ("tearing") ± syncope. May present with shock, HF, cardiac tamponade (Beck's triad: muffled heart sounds, hypotension, ↑JVP).

**Ix:** ECG (*why:* helps exclude STEMI as an alternative/co-existing diagnosis (a dissection can also occlude a coronary ostium and cause true concurrent MI); *what:* may be normal or show ischaemic changes if a coronary is involved). CXR (*why:* rapid initial screen while arranging CT; *what:* may show a widened mediastinum, though a normal CXR does not exclude dissection). Bloods incl. group & save/X-match (*why:* prepares for possible urgent surgery/transfusion; *what:* baseline, and D-dimer can be used to help rule out low-probability dissection though isn't definitive). CT aortogram (*why:* the definitive diagnostic test — fast, widely available, defines the anatomy/extent for surgical planning; *what:* intimal flap with true and false lumen). TTE/TOE (*why:* an alternative first-line test where immediately available, especially useful if the patient is too unstable to move to CT, and assesses for tamponade/aortic regurgitation as complications; *what:* may show the intimal flap, pericardial effusion, or aortic regurgitation).

**Mx:**
- **Immediate/acute:** initial resuscitation — O2, fluids, inotropes if needed, pain control; strict BP/HR control — target HR <60, SBP ≤100–120mmHg — with IV β-blocker first-line (esmolol/labetalol), or verapamil/diltiazem if β-blocker contraindicated (rate control first, then vasodilator if BP remains high, to avoid reflex tachycardia worsening shear stress).
- **Definitive:** Type A → emergency surgery (high mortality without it); complicated Type B (malperfusion, rupture, refractory pain/HTN) → urgent TEVAR (thoracic endovascular aortic repair) or open surgery if TEVAR contraindicated; uncomplicated Type B → continue medical (BP/HR control) treatment, with TEVAR considered within 6 weeks if increased risk features for complications are present.
- **Chronic/long-term:** for chronic dissection (>90 days after the acute event, whether managed surgically or medically) — ongoing careful HR and BP control; aggressive cardiovascular risk factor management (smoking cessation, statin); regular surveillance imaging for late aneurysmal degeneration of the false lumen.

TEVAR = thoracic endovascular aortic repair

**P:** left untreated, up to 60% mortality within 24h for Type A with rupture.

### 0.36.6 Varicose Veins

**D:** Subcutaneous, permanently dilated veins.

**R:** ↑age, family history, F>M, increasing number of pregnancies, DVT, obesity

**S/Smx:** visibly bulging veins (more apparent when standing), aching, throbbing, itchy, ± other signs of chronic venous insufficiency

**Ix:** venous duplex USS (*why:* confirms the diagnosis, identifies the site/extent of reflux, and guides treatment planning; *what:* retrograde venous flow (reflux) in the affected superficial veins).

**Mx:**
- **Definitive/chronic (this condition doesn't have a separate acute tier):**
  - Conservative first-line: leg elevation, weight loss, regular exercise, graduated compression stockings
  - Referral to vascular surgery if: significant symptoms, previous bleeding from varicose veins, skin changes secondary to chronic venous insufficiency, superficial thrombophlebitis, active or healed venous leg ulcer
  - Procedural options once referred/funded (see box below): endothermal ablation, foam sclerotherapy, or surgical ligation/stripping

> [!info] Verified against MBS Online / Victorian statewide referral criteria, Aug 2026 — Australia has a broadly similar (not identical) symptoms-based funding gate, via the MBS rather than NICE.
> Since Nov 2021 MBS reforms, Medicare-funded varicose vein treatment (endothermal ablation, foam sclerotherapy, surgical ligation/stripping) requires symptomatic disease (pain, swelling, skin changes, ulceration, bleeding, superficial thrombophlebitis) and usually documented failure of conservative management (compression stockings) first — cosmetic-only presentations (spider veins, asymptomatic varicosities) are not funded. Public-hospital vascular referral criteria (e.g. Victorian statewide criteria) further stratify by CEAP classification. This is functionally similar in spirit to the NICE "significant symptoms" gate but is its own Australian funding framework (MBS Review Taskforce/MSAC-driven) — don't cite NICE for it.

**P:** even if treated, new varicosities are likely to develop over time.

### 0.36.7 Chronic Venous Insufficiency — skin changes
- Telangiectasia
- Reticular veins (dilated, non-palpable, subdermal veins ≤3mm)
- Corona phlebectatica (malleolar/ankle flare — fan-shaped small veins on ankle/foot)
- Varicose veins
- Atrophie blanche (localised round areas of white, shiny, atrophic skin surrounded by small dilated capillaries)
- Lipodermatosclerosis (localised chronic inflammatory/fibrotic condition, especially malleolar region)
- Hyperpigmentation ("brawny oedema" — reddish-brown discolouration from haemosiderin deposition)
- Dry, scaling eczema (venous stasis dermatitis)
- Venous ulcers in the gaiter area

### 0.36.8 Lower Leg Ulcers

| | Venous | Arterial | Neuropathic |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Location** | Above ankle | Toes and heels | Plantar surface of metatarsal head and hallux |
| **Pain** | Usually painless | Painful | Variable |
| **Appearance** | Shallow, undefined borders | Deep, punched-out | — |
| **Associations** | Previous DVT, oedema, chronic venous insufficiency skin changes | Gangrene, PAD | Especially in diabetics |
| **Ix** | Doppler USS (*why:* confirms venous reflux as the driver, and excludes concurrent arterial disease before compression; *what:* reflux pattern) | Low ABPI (*why:* confirms arterial insufficiency as the cause and its severity; *what:* ABPI <0.9, often <0.5 in severe disease — see 0.35.2) | Exclude other causes (*why:* neuropathic ulcers need a workup for the underlying neuropathy, most commonly diabetic; *what:* screen with monofilament testing, HbA1c) |
| **Mx** | **Definitive:** compression banding after excluding arterial disease (compression is contraindicated with significant arterial disease — always check ABPI first); skin grafting if no healing by 12 weeks or large ulcer. **Chronic:** leg elevation, weight management, ongoing compression to prevent recurrence | **Definitive:** revascularisation as per PAD (section 0.35.1) — compression is contraindicated. **Chronic:** risk factor management as per PAD | **Definitive:** offloading, wound care, treat infection if present. **Chronic:** advise cushioned shoes to reduce callus formation, diabetic foot care education, regular podiatry review |

**Marjolin's ulcer:** squamous cell carcinoma located at sites of chronic inflammation (e.g. burn scars).

**Pyoderma gangrenosum:** see dermatology notes (section 09.02 in source).


### 0.36.9 Popliteal Artery Aneurysm

> [!info] Verified against the Society for Vascular Surgery's 2021/2022 clinical practice guidelines on popliteal artery aneurysms — the content below (≥2cm/20mm intervention threshold for asymptomatic PAA, screening for contralateral PAA and AAA given the strong association, thrombosis/embolisation as the dominant complication risk rather than rupture) matches current international consensus exactly, and there's no indication of a materially different Australian-specific threshold — vascular surgery guidance in this area is genuinely international rather than jurisdiction-specific, so this doesn't need further localisation.

**D:** Focal dilation of the popliteal artery ≥1.5x normal diameter (normal ~7–11mm); most common peripheral artery aneurysm. Bilateral in ~50%; associated with AAA in up to 30–50% of cases.

**R:** male (M>>F, ~95%), smoking, HTN, atherosclerosis, age >65, concurrent AAA or other aneurysmal disease.

**A/P:** degeneration of the arterial wall (same atherosclerotic/connective-tissue process as AAA) → focal dilation → risk of thrombosis, distal embolisation, or (less often than AAA) rupture.

**S/Smx:** often asymptomatic, found incidentally or on screening once AAA is diagnosed (given the association); pulsatile popliteal mass; may present with acute limb ischaemia (thrombosis/embolisation — most common complication, more so than rupture), claudication, or a DVT-mimicking picture from compression of the popliteal vein.

**Ix:** duplex USS (screening/diagnosis) — *why:* confirms diameter and detects thrombus, most sensitive first-line test; *what:* focal dilation ≥2cm generally considered aneurysmal and warranting surveillance/referral. CTA — *why:* for surgical/endovascular planning if intervention being considered; *what:* defines run-off vessels and aneurysm extent. Also image the aorta and contralateral popliteal artery given the strong bilateral/AAA association.

**Mx:**
- **Immediate/acute** (if presenting with acute limb ischaemia from thrombosis/embolisation): as per acute limb ischaemia — urgent vascular surgical review, anticoagulation, thrombolysis or surgical thrombectomy/bypass as appropriate.
- **Definitive:** surgical or endovascular repair (bypass with exclusion, or endovascular stent-graft) if symptomatic, or if asymptomatic and ≥2–2.5cm (varies by institution) or containing significant thrombus, given high complication risk if left untreated.
- **Chronic/surveillance:** regular duplex USS surveillance for small, asymptomatic aneurysms not yet meeting intervention threshold; screen for AAA and contralateral popliteal aneurysm.

**P:** untreated symptomatic popliteal aneurysms carry a high risk of limb loss if they thrombose/embolise (higher acute limb-threat risk than AAA rupture risk); outcomes are good with elective repair before a thrombotic event occurs.

## 0.37 Pulmonary Hypertension

> [!info] Verified against Services Australia/PBS data on PAH medicine subsidy, Aug 2026 — the WHO classification, haemodynamic definition, and Group-specific management approach below are internationally standard and don't need jurisdiction-specific correction; the drug list (bosentan, macitentan, sildenafil, tadalafil, epoprostenol, and others) is confirmed accurate for Australian availability. One genuinely Australia-specific detail worth adding: PAH-specific therapy in Australia is funded via **PBS Section 100 (Highly Specialised Drugs Program)**, with **combination (dual/triple) therapy specifically requiring at least WHO Functional Class III symptoms** — monotherapy is available more broadly, but escalating to combination therapy has this specific funding-access threshold, a genuinely Australian administrative detail not found in general international teaching sources. This is a specialist-initiated therapy area in practice, so the exact current PBS criteria are less critical for a medical student to memorise than the overall Group-based treatment logic already below, but worth knowing the access-gating concept exists.

**D:** Mean pulmonary artery pressure >20 mmHg at rest (current haemodynamic definition). Classified into 5 WHO groups by underlying cause.

> [!info] WHO classification
> 1. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) — idiopathic, heritable, drug/toxin-induced, connective tissue disease (esp. systemic sclerosis), HIV, portal hypertension, congenital heart disease
> 2. Due to left heart disease (most common cause overall — HFpEF/HFrEF, valvular disease)
> 3. Due to lung disease/hypoxia (COPD, ILD, OSA) — this group = cor pulmonale
> 4. Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) — from unresolved PE
> 5. Unclear/multifactorial mechanisms (haematological, systemic, metabolic disorders)

**R:** varies by group — connective tissue disease (esp. systemic sclerosis), left heart disease, chronic lung disease/OSA, prior PE, HIV, portal hypertension, appetite-suppressant drug use, family history (BMPR2 mutation in heritable PAH).

**A/P:** progressive pulmonary vascular remodelling/obstruction (Group 1), or elevated left-sided filling pressures transmitted back to the pulmonary circulation (Group 2), or chronic hypoxic vasoconstriction and vascular remodelling (Group 3) → increased right ventricular afterload → RV hypertrophy then dilation/failure (cor pulmonale) → death from right heart failure if untreated.

**S/Smx:** progressive exertional dyspnoea (earliest and most common symptom), fatigue, exertional syncope/pre-syncope, chest pain, palpitations. Signs of right heart failure in advanced disease (↑JVP, peripheral oedema, hepatomegaly, ascites), loud P2, right ventricular heave, tricuspid regurgitation murmur.

**Ix:** TTE — *why:* first-line non-invasive screen, estimates pulmonary artery systolic pressure and assesses RV size/function; *what:* elevated estimated PASP, RV hypertrophy/dilation, tricuspid regurgitation. ECG — *why:* screens for RV strain; *what:* right axis deviation, RBBB, P pulmonale. CXR — *why:* screens for underlying lung disease and enlarged pulmonary arteries; *what:* prominent pulmonary arteries, RV enlargement, underlying lung pathology if Group 3. Bloods (NTproBNP — *why:* prognostic marker of RV strain; *what:* elevated correlates with severity), autoimmune serology (ANA, RF, anti-centromere/Scl-70) — *why:* screens for underlying connective tissue disease if PAH suspected; *what:* positive in associated CTD. V/Q scan — *why:* screens for CTEPH as a treatable cause; *what:* mismatched perfusion defects. Right heart catheterisation — *why:* gold-standard for definitive diagnosis and haemodynamic classification, required before starting PAH-specific therapy; *what:* confirms mean PAP, measures pulmonary vascular resistance and wedge pressure (distinguishes pre- from post-capillary PH).

**Mx:**
- **Immediate/acute (decompensated RV failure):** O2, cautious diuresis, avoid excessive preload reduction; inotropes if cardiogenic shock; treat precipitant.
- **Definitive (Group-specific, specialist-initiated):**
  - Group 1 (PAH): PAH-specific therapy — endothelin receptor antagonists (e.g. bosentan, macitentan), PDE5 inhibitors (e.g. sildenafil, tadalafil), prostacyclin analogues (e.g. epoprostenol) for severe disease; anticoagulation historically used in idiopathic PAH (now more selective); lung transplant for refractory disease.
  - Group 2: treat the underlying left heart disease as per heart failure/valvular disease Mx above.
  - Group 3: treat underlying lung disease, long-term O2 therapy if hypoxic.
  - Group 4 (CTEPH): pulmonary endarterectomy (potentially curative) or balloon pulmonary angioplasty/PAH-specific therapy if inoperable; lifelong anticoagulation.
- **Chronic/long-term:** exercise training (supervised), influenza/pneumococcal vaccination, avoid pregnancy in PAH (high mortality risk), regular specialist follow-up with repeat risk stratification.

**P:** historically poor without treatment (idiopathic PAH median survival ~2.8 years untreated); has improved substantially with modern PAH-specific therapy, but remains a progressive, life-limiting condition overall; prognosis is generally better for Group 2/3 disease if the underlying cause is treatable.

## 0.38 Congenital Heart Disease (incl. Coarctation of the Aorta)

> [!note] Gap-filled from CSV (Cardiology category, High yield) — the source UK notes mention coarctation only in passing (as a cause of HTN and as an aortic dissection risk factor) with no standalone entry, and congenital heart disease as a topic is entirely absent. This is an adult/intern-level overview — full paediatric congenital cardiology detail belongs in the Paediatrics files; cross-reference rather than duplicating there.

**D:** Structural heart abnormalities present from birth. Broadly divided into acyanotic (L→R shunt, or obstructive lesions without shunt) and cyanotic (R→L shunt) lesions.

> [!info] Common lesions
> **Acyanotic (shunt):** ASD, VSD (most common congenital heart defect overall), PDA
> **Acyanotic (obstructive, no shunt):** coarctation of the aorta, aortic/pulmonary stenosis
> **Cyanotic ("5 T's"):** Tetralogy of Fallot (most common cyanotic lesion presenting beyond the neonatal period), Transposition of the great arteries, Truncus arteriosus, Tricuspid atresia, Total anomalous pulmonary venous return

**Coarctation of the aorta — D:** narrowing of the aorta, most commonly just distal to the left subclavian artery origin (juxtaductal). Associated with bicuspid aortic valve (~50–85%), Turner syndrome.

**S/Smx (coarctation):** may be picked up as neonatal collapse (duct-dependent, presents when the ductus arteriosus closes) or, in milder/adult cases, incidentally via HTN, radiofemoral delay, weak/delayed femoral pulses, ejection systolic murmur (loudest over the back), differential BP between arms and legs (higher in arms), bicuspid aortic valve murmur if present.

**Ix (coarctation):** echo (diagnostic in most cases, assesses associated lesions), 4-limb BP measurement — *why:* screens for the characteristic arm-leg BP gradient; *what:* higher BP in upper limbs than lower limbs. CXR — *why:* screens for chronic collateral vessel changes in older undiagnosed patients; *what:* rib notching (from dilated intercostal collaterals), "3 sign" (indentation at the coarctation site). CT/MR angiography — *why:* for definitive anatomical delineation and surgical/procedural planning; *what:* confirms site, length, and severity of narrowing.

**Mx (coarctation):**
- **Immediate/acute** (neonatal, duct-dependent): prostaglandin E1 infusion to keep the ductus arteriosus open, stabilise, urgent surgical/interventional referral.
- **Definitive:** surgical repair (resection and end-to-end anastomosis, or patch aortoplasty) or balloon angioplasty ± stenting, depending on age and anatomy.
- **Chronic/long-term:** lifelong BP monitoring (recoarctation and persistent HTN are common even after successful repair), regular follow-up for aneurysm at the repair site, endocarditis prophylaxis considerations if a prosthetic material is in situ, cardiology follow-up into adulthood (adult congenital heart disease service).

> [!info] General principles for other congenital lesions
> Small ASD/VSD/PDA are often managed conservatively with monitoring, as many close spontaneously in childhood; larger or symptomatic lesions are closed surgically or via catheter-based device closure. Cyanotic lesions (e.g. Tetralogy of Fallot) require staged surgical correction, typically in infancy. See the Paediatrics files for detailed paediatric congenital cardiology and the "5 T's" workup.

**P:** with modern surgical/interventional management, most congenital heart disease patients survive to adulthood, but many (especially coarctation, even post-repair) carry long-term cardiovascular risk (HTN, aortic aneurysm, recoarctation) requiring lifelong specialist follow-up — this is the basis of the growing "adult congenital heart disease" subspecialty.

## 0.39 Carotid Artery Stenosis

> [!note] Gap-filled from CSV (Cardiology category, Medium yield, "partially covered") — not present as a standalone entry in the source UK notes.

**D:** Narrowing of the internal carotid artery, usually at the bifurcation, due to atherosclerotic plaque.

**R:** as for atherosclerosis generally — smoking, HTN, ↑cholesterol, DM, age, family history.

**A/P:** atherosclerotic plaque formation at the carotid bifurcation → luminal narrowing and/or a source of embolic material → transient or permanent cerebral/retinal ischaemia if plaque ruptures or embolises.

**S/Smx:** often asymptomatic (picked up on carotid bruit on exam or incidentally on imaging); symptomatic disease presents as TIA or ischaemic stroke in the relevant vascular territory, or amaurosis fugax (transient monocular vision loss). Carotid bruit on auscultation (not sensitive or specific alone).

**Ix:** carotid duplex USS — *why:* first-line, non-invasive screening/diagnostic test; *what:* measures degree of stenosis (NASCET criteria) and plaque characteristics. CTA or MRA — *why:* used to confirm/better characterise stenosis severity before intervention, particularly if duplex is equivocal; *what:* defines % stenosis and plaque morphology for surgical planning.

**Mx:**
- **Immediate/acute** (if presenting with TIA/stroke): manage as per acute stroke/TIA pathway; urgent carotid imaging.
- **Definitive:** 
  - Symptomatic stenosis ≥70% (or 50–69% in selected patients) → carotid endarterectomy, ideally within 2 weeks of the neurological event (benefit diminishes with delay) — or carotid artery stenting in select cases.
  - Asymptomatic stenosis — intervention (endarterectomy/stenting) is more selective, generally considered for ≥70–80% stenosis in patients with acceptable surgical risk and reasonable life expectancy, weighed against strong medical therapy given the more modest absolute benefit than in symptomatic disease.
- **Chronic/long-term (all patients):** best medical therapy — antiplatelet (aspirin or clopidogrel), high-intensity statin, BP control, smoking cessation, diabetes management — regardless of whether intervention is undertaken.

**P:** untreated symptomatic significant stenosis carries a high recurrent stroke risk in the following weeks; endarterectomy substantially reduces this risk when performed promptly in appropriately selected symptomatic patients.

## 0.40 Dyslipidaemia

> [!note] Gap-filled from CSV (Cardiology category, Medium yield) — not covered as a standalone topic in the source UK notes (lipids are mentioned only as an ACS/IHD risk factor and via statin prescribing). Generated from general knowledge and RACGP/Heart Foundation material; specific numeric LDL/non-HDL targets flagged below as needing direct confirmation against the current Heart Foundation/AMH position, since these are exactly the kind of number that could be stale by the exam.

**D:** Abnormal lipid levels (↑LDL-C, ↑triglycerides, and/or ↓HDL-C) that increase atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk.

**R:** family history (including familial hypercholesterolaemia), diet, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, alcohol excess, DM, hypothyroidism, CKD, nephrotic syndrome, certain drugs (thiazides, corticosteroids, antipsychotics, retinoids).

**A/P:** primary (genetic, e.g. familial hypercholesterolaemia — autosomal dominant LDL receptor defect) or secondary (diet, obesity, DM, hypothyroidism, CKD, drugs, alcohol) causes of abnormal lipoprotein metabolism → LDL deposition in arterial walls → atherosclerotic plaque formation → increased risk of ACS, stroke, PAD.

**S/Smx:** usually asymptomatic, detected on screening lipid profile. Familial hypercholesterolaemia may present with tendon xanthomata (esp. Achilles), xanthelasma, corneal arcus (especially if <45yo), and a strong family history of premature CVD.

**Ix:** fasting or non-fasting lipid profile (total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides) — *why:* establishes baseline and risk category; *what:* elevated LDL-C/triglycerides, low HDL-C. TSH, fasting glucose/HbA1c, U&E, LFT — *why:* screens for secondary causes and establishes a safe baseline before starting a statin; *what:* identifies hypothyroidism, diabetes, renal/hepatic disease as contributors, and baseline LFTs for statin monitoring.

**Mx:**
- **Immediate:** not an acute-management condition (unless presenting as an ASCVD event, managed per that condition, e.g. ACS).
- **Definitive:** treatment decisions are driven by **absolute cardiovascular risk** (as for hypertension — AusCVD Risk Calculator) rather than lipid levels alone, except in high-risk groups (known ASCVD, familial hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes with other risk factors, CKD) where statin therapy is recommended regardless of baseline LDL-C. Statins are first-line lipid-lowering therapy; ezetimibe added if target not reached on maximally tolerated statin; PCSK9 inhibitors reserved for very high-risk patients not at target on statin + ezetimibe (specialist-initiated, PBS-restricted).
- **Chronic/long-term:** lifestyle modification (diet, exercise, weight loss, smoking cessation, alcohol moderation) for all patients regardless of drug therapy; periodic lipid re-check after initiating/titrating therapy; manage secondary causes if present.

> [!info] Verified against Heart Foundation Australia, Aug 2026 — current Australian LDL-C targets confirmed, including a recently-updated, more intensive post-ACS target.
> **General Australian guidance:** LDL-C <2.0mmol/L for primary prevention; <1.8mmol/L for secondary prevention (established ASCVD).
> **Updated 2025 Heart Foundation ACS-specific guideline:** for patients post-ACS specifically, a more intensive target of **LDL-C <1.4mmol/L AND ≥50% reduction from baseline** — aligning Australian post-ACS practice with the more aggressive international (ESC/ACC) direction of travel. Use this tighter post-ACS-specific target rather than the general <1.8mmol/L secondary-prevention figure when the context is specifically post-ACS.

**P:** lipid-lowering therapy (particularly statins) produces a well-established, dose-dependent reduction in ASCVD events in appropriately risk-stratified patients; benefit is proportional to baseline risk and degree of LDL-C reduction achieved.

## 0.41 Cardiac Ectopic Beats (PVCs, PACs)

> [!note] Gap-filled from CSV (Cardiology category, Medium yield) — not covered as a standalone topic in the source UK notes.

**D:** Premature depolarisations arising outside the normal sinus node pathway. Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) arise from an ectopic ventricular focus; premature atrial contractions (PACs) arise from an ectopic atrial focus.

**R:** caffeine, alcohol, stimulant drugs, electrolyte disturbance (↓K, ↓Mg), stress/anxiety, sleep deprivation, structural heart disease (more relevant for frequent/high-burden PVCs), hyperthyroidism, sympathomimetic drugs.

**A/P:** an ectopic focus depolarises earlier than the next expected sinus impulse → premature beat, usually followed by a compensatory pause (more complete after a PVC than a PAC, since PACs can reset the sinus node).

**S/Smx:** often asymptomatic and detected incidentally on ECG/Holter monitoring; may cause a sensation of a "skipped beat," fluttering, or a forceful subsequent beat (from the increased stroke volume of the post-ectopic beat). PVCs: wide, bizarre QRS not preceded by a P wave. PACs: an early, abnormally-shaped P wave followed by a usually-normal QRS (may be aberrantly conducted).

**Ix:** ECG — *why:* confirms the diagnosis and characterises morphology (helps localise the ectopic focus and distinguish benign from concerning patterns); *what:* premature wide QRS without preceding P wave (PVC) or premature abnormal P wave (PAC). Holter monitor — *why:* quantifies burden (ectopic beats as % of total beats over 24h) when frequent/symptomatic, since high burden (generally >10-20% of beats) can itself cause a reversible cardiomyopathy; *what:* establishes ectopic burden and any associated non-sustained arrhythmia. Bloods (U&E including Mg, TFT) — *why:* screens for reversible electrolyte/endocrine triggers; *what:* hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, or thyrotoxicosis as contributors. Echo — *why:* to exclude underlying structural heart disease, particularly if PVCs are frequent/high-burden or symptomatic; *what:* usually normal in idiopathic ectopy; may reveal cardiomyopathy in structural disease.

**Mx:**
- **Immediate:** none required for isolated, infrequent, asymptomatic ectopics with a structurally normal heart.
- **Definitive:** correct any identified reversible trigger (reduce caffeine/alcohol/stimulants, correct electrolytes, treat hyperthyroidism). Reassurance for benign, low-burden ectopy. β-blockers first-line if symptomatic despite trigger avoidance. Catheter ablation considered for high-burden, symptomatic PVCs refractory to medical therapy, or if PVC-induced cardiomyopathy develops.
- **Chronic/long-term:** periodic reassessment (Holter ± echo) if burden is high, to monitor for the development of PVC-induced cardiomyopathy.

**P:** excellent in the absence of structural heart disease and with low ectopic burden — a normal variant in most people. High-burden PVCs (particularly sustained >10-20% of total beats) carry a small but real risk of causing a reversible dilated cardiomyopathy if untreated, which typically improves with successful suppression/ablation.

---

## 0.42 Restrictive Cardiomyopathy

> [!note] Gap-filled from CSV (Cardiology category, Medium yield) — dilated cardiomyopathy and HOCM are covered in the source notes but restrictive cardiomyopathy is not.

**D:** Cardiomyopathy characterised by rigid, non-compliant ventricular walls causing impaired diastolic filling, with typically preserved systolic function (until late disease) and normal or near-normal wall thickness/chamber size (distinguishing it from HOCM and DCM respectively).

**Causes:** infiltrative (amyloidosis — most common cause in developed countries, sarcoidosis, haemochromatosis), storage diseases (Fabry disease), endomyocardial (endomyocardial fibrosis, Loeffler endocarditis/hypereosinophilic syndrome), idiopathic, post-radiation fibrosis.

**A/P:** infiltration or fibrosis of the myocardium → stiff, non-compliant ventricles → impaired diastolic filling with a rapid early rise in filling pressure → elevated atrial pressures and biatrial enlargement → predominantly right and left heart failure symptoms with relatively preserved ejection fraction until late in the disease course.

**S/Smx:** heart failure symptoms — dyspnoea, fatigue, exercise intolerance; signs of right heart failure often prominent (↑JVP with rapid x and y descent, ascites, peripheral oedema, hepatomegaly); S3 or S4; features of the underlying infiltrative disease may be present (e.g. macroglossia, periorbital purpura in amyloidosis; skin/joint findings in sarcoidosis; bronze skin, diabetes in haemochromatosis).

**Ix:** ECG — *why:* screens for low-voltage QRS which is characteristic (and helps distinguish from LVH-causing conditions) plus arrhythmia/conduction disease common in infiltrative disease; *what:* low voltage (classically in amyloidosis, despite echo showing thickened walls — a discordance that's a diagnostic clue), conduction abnormalities. Echo — *why:* assesses diastolic function, wall thickness, and chamber size, and screens for the "granular sparkling" appearance of amyloid; *what:* restrictive filling pattern, biatrial enlargement, preserved EF, normal/mildly increased wall thickness. Cardiac MRI — *why:* better differentiates restrictive cardiomyopathy from constrictive pericarditis (an important clinical mimic) and characterises infiltrative tissue; *what:* late gadolinium enhancement pattern suggestive of amyloid/sarcoid infiltration. Endomyocardial biopsy — *why:* definitive tissue diagnosis when non-invasive workup is inconclusive; *what:* confirms the specific infiltrative process. Additional targeted Ix per suspected cause (e.g. serum/urine electrophoresis and fat pad biopsy for amyloid, ferritin/genetic testing for haemochromatosis, ACE level for sarcoidosis).

> [!info] Key differential: Restrictive Cardiomyopathy vs Constrictive Pericarditis
> Both cause a restrictive filling pattern, but the underlying pathology (and management) differs completely — constrictive pericarditis is a pericardial disease (surgically correctable via pericardiectomy), while restrictive cardiomyopathy is myocardial (usually not). MRI and cardiac catheterisation (looking at discordance between LV and RV pressures during respiration) are key to distinguishing them; misdiagnosis matters because constrictive pericarditis is potentially curable with surgery.

**Mx:**
- **Immediate/acute (decompensated HF):** diuretics for congestion — used cautiously, as restrictive physiology is preload-dependent and over-diuresis can drop cardiac output.
- **Definitive:** treat the underlying cause where possible (e.g. disease-modifying therapy for amyloidosis — e.g. tafamidis for transthyretin amyloidosis, or chemotherapy for light-chain amyloidosis; venesection for haemochromatosis; immunosuppression for sarcoidosis).
- **Chronic/long-term:** heart failure symptom management as per chronic HF (see section 0.27), with caution around standard HFrEF drug titration since these patients are often preload-dependent and intolerant of vasodilators/negative inotropes; rate control (avoiding aggressive negative chronotropes) if AF develops (common, given atrial enlargement); consider anticoagulation given AF/stasis risk from the enlarged, poorly-contracting atria; heart transplant for refractory end-stage disease in selected patients.

**P:** generally poor, especially for infiltrative causes such as amyloidosis, unless the underlying disease is identified early and disease-modifying therapy is available; significantly better if a treatable secondary cause (e.g. haemochromatosis) is identified and treated early.

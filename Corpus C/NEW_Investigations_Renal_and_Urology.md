# NEW — Investigations: Renal and Urology

> [!danger] **Sourcing limitation applying to this whole file.** Australian primary guideline domains are **egress-blocked** (verified 2026-08-30); AMH and Therapeutic Guidelines are subscription-gated. Entries are **snippet-sourced**. Numerics appear only on three-source agreement; assay- or laboratory-dependent values are **omitted with the omission stated in place**.

> [!warning] **Mis-filed items in this category:** `Adrenal / Cortisol` and `Metanephrines` are endocrine tests, and `Fecal Incontinence` is a **symptom, not an investigation**. Each is built as listed with the mis-filing noted.

---

## 0.1 Urinalysis Panel (Dipstick, pH, Specific Gravity, Microscopy, Culture)

**D:** Bedside **reagent strip** testing (pH, specific gravity, blood, protein, glucose, ketones, nitrites, leucocyte esterase, bilirubin, urobilinogen) plus laboratory **microscopy** (cells, casts, crystals, organisms) and **culture with sensitivities**.

**Ind:** Suspected urinary tract infection; haematuria; proteinuria; acute kidney injury and CKD assessment; suspected glomerulonephritis; diabetes and its complications; unexplained systemic illness; antenatal screening; pre-operative assessment.

**Role:** **The cheapest, fastest and highest-yield test in nephrology and urology**, and the one most often under-used. In suspected glomerular disease it is effectively the bedside biopsy — **an active sediment changes the whole pathway**.

> [!danger] **Do not ignore**
> **Red cell casts or dysmorphic red cells** — glomerulonephritis. With acute kidney injury this is a **nephrological emergency**; see the vasculitis serology entry in `NEW_Investigations_Infectious_Diseases.md` 0.21 and [[12_04_Rheum_-_Vasculitis]].
> **Visible (macroscopic) haematuria in an adult** — urological malignancy until excluded, regardless of anticoagulation or a concurrent UTI.
> **Glycosuria with ketonuria** — check a capillary glucose and ketones; consider DKA, including **euglycaemic DKA on an SGLT2 inhibitor**, where the glucose may be near-normal.

> [!warning] **Asymptomatic bacteriuria is not a UTI.** It is common in older people, in the catheterised, and in residential care, and **treating it does not help and drives resistance and *C. difficile***. The exceptions where it *is* treated are **pregnancy** and **before urological procedures that breach the mucosa**. A positive dipstick in a delirious older person does not explain the delirium — see the Acute Confusion entry in `NEW_Neurology.md`.

**Normal/interpretation:** Dipstick positives for protein, nitrite, leucocytes or blood should prompt **microscopy**. Nitrites are reasonably specific for Enterobacterales but insensitive (organisms that do not reduce nitrate, or short bladder dwell time give false negatives). Leucocyte esterase is more sensitive, less specific. **Sterile pyuria** — think prior antibiotics, urethritis/STI, **renal tract tuberculosis**, stones, tumour, interstitial nephritis. **Heavy proteinuria on dipstick (≥3+)** is described in sources as high-grade and warrants quantification (see 0.2).

**Abnormal → next steps:** Culture before antibiotics where practical; quantify proteinuria by ACR/PCR; ultrasound for obstruction or stones; nephrology referral for an active sediment.

**Alt:** ACR/PCR (quantification); renal tract ultrasound; CT KUB for stones; cystoscopy for haematuria; renal biopsy.

## 0.2 Urine ACR (Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio)

**D:** Ratio of urinary albumin to creatinine, correcting for urine concentration; measured on a **first-morning spot sample** where possible.

**Ind:** **Screening and staging of CKD**, especially in diabetes and hypertension; quantifying proteinuria; cardiovascular risk assessment.

**Role:** **The standard quantitative measure of albuminuria**, and it has replaced 24-hour collections for most purposes. Albuminuria is an **independent predictor of both renal and cardiovascular outcome**, not just a marker of kidney damage — which is why it belongs in cardiovascular risk assessment as well as renal.

> [!info] **CKD is staged on two axes together — eGFR *and* albuminuria (KDIGO)**
> **Albuminuria categories:** **A1** normal to mildly increased · **A2** moderately increased · **A3** severely increased. **Persistence for ≥3 months** is required for a CKD diagnosis.
> **eGFR categories:** **G1** ≥90 · **G2** 60–<90 · **G3a** 45–<60 · **G3b** 30–<45 · **G4** 15–<30 · **G5** <15 mL/min/1.73 m².

> [!danger] **A units trap, and it is a real one in Australia.** The KDIGO albuminuria category boundaries are commonly published in **mg/g**, while **Australian laboratories report ACR in mg/mmol** — the numeric boundaries are therefore completely different. **Converting the figures myself would be presenting my own arithmetic as a sourced threshold, so the numeric boundaries are deliberately omitted here.** Use the **A1/A2/A3 category printed on the Australian report**, which the laboratory has already applied to its own units. This is the same class of error as quoting a US prolactin or PSA figure in the wrong units.

**Normal/abnormal:** Confirm an abnormal result on a repeat sample. **Transient albuminuria** occurs with fever, exercise, heart failure, hyperglycaemia and UTI — repeat when the patient is well before labelling CKD.

**Alt:** Urine protein:creatinine ratio (**PCR** — better where non-albumin proteins matter, as in myeloma); 24-hour urine protein (largely superseded, error-prone); dipstick (screening only — sources note it performs less well than ACR for CKD screening).

## 0.3 Renal Function Panel (Urea, Creatinine, eGFR, Electrolytes)

**D:** Serum urea, creatinine and calculated **eGFR**, with sodium, potassium, chloride and bicarbonate.

**Ind:** Ubiquitous — acute illness, drug dosing and monitoring, CKD staging and surveillance, before contrast or nephrotoxic drugs, fluid and electrolyte problems.

**Role:** First-line and continuous. **eGFR is an estimate with assumptions**, and knowing where it fails is what distinguishes safe prescribing.

> [!warning] **Where eGFR misleads, and it matters most in exactly the patients you worry about**
> - **Creatinine depends on muscle mass** — so eGFR **overestimates** function in the **elderly, cachectic, amputees, and those with chronic liver disease or malnutrition**, and **underestimates** it in the very muscular. A "normal" creatinine in a frail 85-year-old can conceal substantial renal impairment.
> - **eGFR equations assume steady state** and are **invalid in acute kidney injury**, where creatinine lags behind the true GFR by hours to days — so a rising creatinine understates how bad things already are.
> - Drugs alter creatinine without altering GFR — **trimethoprim** and others reduce tubular secretion; this is a benign rise, not injury.
> - **Cystatin C-based eGFR** is recommended by KDIGO alongside creatinine where available, and helps precisely in these discordant situations.

> [!danger] **Do not ignore**
> **Hyperkalaemia** — an ECG and treatment decision, not a number to file. **A rising creatinine with anuria** — think obstruction, and scan the bladder and kidneys; post-renal AKI is the reversible one. **Any AKI: review the drug chart immediately** and withhold nephrotoxics (NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors/ARBs, diuretics, metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors) per local sick-day guidance.

**Normal/abnormal:** Reference intervals are laboratory-specific and **not stated here**. A **urea:creatinine ratio raised out of proportion** supports pre-renal states or upper GI bleeding.

**Alt:** Cystatin C; measured creatinine clearance; renal tract ultrasound; urinalysis; **CKD staging requires ACR alongside** (see 0.2).

## 0.4 Dark Urine

> [!warning] **A sign, not a test.** Built as listed.

**D:** Urine darker than expected — the diagnostic task is to decide **which pigment**.

**Interpretation — the differential is short and separable by dipstick:**
- **Concentrated urine** (dehydration) — the commonest cause; dipstick negative for blood, high specific gravity.
- **Bilirubinuria** — **conjugated** hyperbilirubinaemia; dark urine **with pale stools** signals cholestasis (see the Pale Stools entry in `NEW_Investigations_Gastroenterology.md` 0.31). Unconjugated bilirubin is not water-soluble and does **not** darken urine — so **dark urine in jaundice means the bilirubin is conjugated**, which is a genuinely useful bedside inference.
- **Haematuria** — dipstick positive for blood, **red cells present** on microscopy.
- **Haemoglobinuria** (intravascular haemolysis) or **myoglobinuria** (rhabdomyolysis) — **dipstick positive for blood but microscopy shows no red cells**. This dissociation is the classic and high-yield finding.
- **Drugs and foods** — rifampicin (orange), nitrofurantoin, metronidazole, methyldopa, levodopa, beetroot, senna; **porphyria** (urine darkens on standing in light).

> [!danger] **Do not ignore**
> **Dipstick blood-positive, microscopy red-cell-negative urine after crush injury, prolonged immobility, seizure, extreme exertion or a statin** — **rhabdomyolysis**. Check **creatine kinase, potassium, calcium and renal function urgently**; hyperkalaemia and AKI are the killers.

**Next steps:** Dipstick, microscopy, split bilirubin, CK, LDH and haptoglobin, and a drug history.

## 0.5 Elevated PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen)

**D:** Serum glycoprotein produced by prostatic epithelium — **prostate-specific, not prostate-cancer-specific**, which is the entire interpretive problem.

**Ind:** Symptomatic assessment of suspected prostate cancer; monitoring known disease; and — separately and more contentiously — **screening of asymptomatic men**.

**Role:** Screening role in Australia is **conditional on shared decision-making, not routine**. Sources describe RACGP and Cancer Council Australia guidance as **offering PSA screening to asymptomatic men aged 50–69** (or **from 45 with a first-degree family history**) **only after a conversation that explicitly covers benefits and harms**. *(Guidance in this area is actively being revised — sources reference a draft update — so confirm current recommendations.)*

> [!warning] **Causes of a raised PSA other than cancer** — benign prostatic hyperplasia, **prostatitis or UTI** (which can raise it dramatically and take months to settle), urinary retention, recent **ejaculation, cycling, digital rectal examination, catheterisation, prostate biopsy or surgery**, and increasing age. **Repeat an unexpected result after an interval, having excluded infection, before acting on it.**
> **Free:total PSA ratio** adds discrimination in the intermediate band — sources describe its use where total PSA is between **4 and 10 ng/mL**, with a **lower free:total fraction indicating higher cancer risk**. Note the caveat sources raise: **chronic prostatitis also lowers the free fraction**, so it does not cleanly separate inflammation from cancer.
> **DRE has high specificity but low sensitivity** — a normal examination does not exclude cancer, and DRE alone is not a screening test.

> [!danger] **Do not ignore**
> **A hard, irregular, nodular prostate on DRE**, or PSA with **bone pain, anaemia or raised ALP** — consider metastatic disease and refer urgently, regardless of the PSA value.

**Normal/abnormal:** **No single "normal" cut-off is stated here** — thresholds are age-referenced, assay-dependent, and used differently between guidelines. **PSA velocity and density** are used in interpretation. Rising or persistently elevated PSA → urology referral; contemporary pathways use **multiparametric MRI before biopsy** to reduce unnecessary biopsies.

**Alt:** mpMRI prostate; transperineal or transrectal biopsy; bone scan and CT for staging.

## 0.6 Urine Cytology

**D:** Microscopic examination of exfoliated urothelial cells in voided or washing specimens.

**Ind:** Haematuria work-up; surveillance of known urothelial carcinoma; suspected **carcinoma in situ**; occupational exposure surveillance (aromatic amines, aniline dyes, rubber).

**Role:** **Adjunct, never a substitute for cystoscopy.** Its performance is strongly grade-dependent: **good for high-grade urothelial carcinoma and carcinoma in situ, poor for low-grade papillary tumours**, which exfoliate bland cells. **A numeric sensitivity is deliberately not stated — it did not reach the sourcing standard in this build.**

**Safety/cost:** Non-invasive and inexpensive. **A first-morning specimen is not used** — overnight cells degenerate; a fresh voided sample later in the morning is preferred.

**Normal/abnormal:** Negative cytology **does not exclude bladder cancer**. Positive cytology with a normal cystoscopy should prompt a search for an **upper tract** or prostatic urethral source. False positives occur with stones, infection, instrumentation, and after intravesical BCG or chemotherapy.

**Alt:** **Cystoscopy — the definitive test for bladder mucosa**; CT urography for the upper tracts; urinary tumour-marker assays (variable adoption).

## 0.7 Uroflowmetry

**D:** Non-invasive measurement of urinary flow rate over time, producing a flow curve, with a **post-void residual** measured by bladder scan.

**Ind:** Lower urinary tract symptoms, particularly voiding symptoms in men; suspected bladder outlet obstruction; before and after prostate surgery.

**Role:** Sources describe it as **the initial, non-invasive urodynamic investigation for LUTS**. It is a screening test — **it demonstrates a poor flow but cannot say why**, because obstruction and a weak detrusor produce similar curves.

**Safety/cost:** Non-invasive, cheap, no complications. **Requires an adequately full bladder** — a low voided volume makes the study uninterpretable, which is the commonest technical failure.

**Normal/abnormal:** A normal flow rate and curve with a low residual makes significant obstruction unlikely. **Numeric flow-rate thresholds are not stated** — they are volume- and age-dependent. An intermittent or plateau curve suggests obstruction or stricture; a **significant post-void residual** raises retention and the risk of upper tract damage.

**Alt:** **Formal urodynamics** (see 0.8) where the cause of a poor flow must be established; bladder scan; symptom scores; flexible cystoscopy for stricture.

## 0.8 Urodynamic Studies (UDS)

**D:** Invasive multichannel study measuring bladder and abdominal pressures during filling and voiding, with provocative manoeuvres (cough, Valsalva); **video-urodynamics** adds fluoroscopy.

**Ind:** Sources list: **incongruity between symptoms and clinical findings**; **neurogenic bladder** and neurological disease; persistent LUTS despite appropriate therapy; **before surgery for incontinence**, and in recurrent incontinence after previous surgery; **mixed stress and urge incontinence**; young men with LUTS; selected children with persistent daytime wetting or spinal abnormality; and where a planned therapy carries high complication risk or the diagnosis is otherwise unclear.

**Role:** **The functional gold standard** — it distinguishes detrusor overactivity, stress incontinence, poor compliance, detrusor underactivity and bladder outlet obstruction, which no non-invasive test reliably separates.

> [!warning] **Not a routine test for uncomplicated incontinence.** Straightforward stress or urge incontinence is managed on history, examination and a bladder diary. UDS is reserved for the situations above; performing it routinely subjects patients to an invasive, uncomfortable study that does not change management.

**Safety/cost:** Catheterisation is uncomfortable and carries **UTI risk** (antibiotic prophylaxis is used in some settings), plus haematuria and, rarely, retention. Expensive and specialist.

**Normal/abnormal:** Reported as filling and voiding phase findings. **Numeric pressure thresholds are not stated here.**

**Alt:** Bladder diary and pad testing (cheap, informative, always do first); uroflowmetry with residual; imaging; cystoscopy.

## 0.9 Adrenal / Cortisol Testing (Morning Cortisol, 24-h Urine Free Cortisol, Salivary Cortisol, Short Synacthen, Dexamethasone Suppression)

> [!warning] **Mis-filed** — an endocrine investigation listed under Renal & Urology. Built as listed.

**D:** A family of tests answering two opposite questions: **is there too little cortisol (adrenal insufficiency)** or **too much (Cushing syndrome)**.

**Ind:** **Insufficiency** — unexplained hypotension, hyponatraemia with hyperkalaemia, weight loss, fatigue, hyperpigmentation, hypoglycaemia, or shock unresponsive to fluids; and in anyone on long-term corticosteroids who becomes unwell. **Excess** — central obesity, proximal myopathy, thin skin and easy bruising, striae, new or difficult-to-control diabetes and hypertension, osteoporosis at a young age.

**Role:** **Morning cortisol** screens for insufficiency; the **short Synacthen (ACTH stimulation) test** confirms it. For excess, screening uses **overnight or low-dose dexamethasone suppression, 24-hour urinary free cortisol, or late-night salivary cortisol** — usually two abnormal tests before proceeding.

> [!danger] **Do not ignore — and do not wait for the result**
> **Suspected adrenal crisis is treated immediately with hydrocortisone; the cortisol sample is taken before the dose, but treatment is not delayed for it.** Sudden withdrawal of long-term corticosteroids, or failure to increase the dose during intercurrent illness or surgery, is a preventable cause of crisis. **Corticosteroid doses are deliberately not stated here** (Australian guidance egress-blocked) — use the local adrenal crisis protocol, and know where it is before you need it.

> [!warning] **Interpretation pitfalls** — cortisol has a **diurnal rhythm**, so timing of the sample is part of the test; **oestrogen (including the combined oral contraceptive) raises cortisol-binding globulin** and therefore total cortisol, causing false reassurance or false positives; shift work disrupts the rhythm; and **exogenous corticosteroids of any route — including inhaled, topical and intra-articular — suppress the axis** and must be asked about explicitly.

**Normal/abnormal:** **All numeric thresholds are deliberately omitted** — they are assay-specific and differ between the newer and older cortisol immunoassays, and none met the three-source bar here. Interpret against the reporting laboratory's stated cut-offs and involve endocrinology.

**Alt:** ACTH level (separates primary from secondary); renin and aldosterone; adrenal imaging **after** biochemical confirmation, never before; pituitary MRI.

## 0.10 Metanephrines (Plasma Free or 24-hour Urinary Fractionated)

> [!warning] **Mis-filed** — an endocrine investigation listed under Renal & Urology.

**D:** Measurement of the O-methylated catecholamine metabolites **metanephrine and normetanephrine**, which are produced continuously within the tumour and so are less affected by episodic secretion than catecholamines themselves.

**Ind:** Suspected **phaeochromocytoma or paraganglioma** — paroxysmal hypertension, the triad of **episodic headache, sweating and palpitations**, hypertension in a young patient, resistant hypertension, an **adrenal incidentaloma**, or a relevant family syndrome (**MEN2, von Hippel–Lindau, neurofibromatosis type 1, SDH mutations**).

**Role:** **The screening test of choice**, having replaced urinary catecholamines and VMA.

> [!danger] **Collection conditions and interfering drugs are part of the test, and ignoring them is the commonest cause of a misleading result.** Sources note that **tricyclic antidepressants, SNRIs, labetalol, paracetamol, levodopa, sympathomimetics and caffeine** interfere. Plasma sampling conditions (supine rest before venepuncture, in many protocols) also matter. **Check the reporting laboratory's specific requirements before collecting** — a false positive here leads to unnecessary imaging and a false negative can be fatal at induction of anaesthesia.

> [!warning] **Sequence matters: confirm biochemically, then image.** Adrenal nodules are common incidental findings; imaging first generates confusion. And in a confirmed phaeochromocytoma, **alpha blockade must precede beta blockade** — see the non-selective alpha-blocker entry in `NEW_Drug_Classes_Cardiovascular_Antihypertensives.md`.

**Normal/abnormal:** **Numeric thresholds are omitted** (assay-dependent). Mildly raised results are common and often drug-related; markedly raised results are more specific. Repeat with interfering drugs withdrawn where safe.

**Alt:** Clonidine suppression test in equivocal cases; CT/MRI adrenals; functional imaging (MIBG, DOTATATE PET) for localisation and metastatic disease; genetic testing.

## 0.11 24-hour Urine Copper

**D:** Quantification of copper excreted in a 24-hour urine collection, used with **serum caeruloplasmin**.

**Ind:** Suspected **Wilson disease** — unexplained liver disease in a young person, unexplained neurological or psychiatric disease with liver abnormality, haemolytic anaemia with liver disease, or a family history.

**Role:** Part of a **composite diagnosis** — no single test is diagnostic.

> [!info] **The figures sources give** — serum caeruloplasmin **below about 0.2 g/L**, with 24-hour urinary copper excretion **above roughly 40 µg/day in children and 100 µg/day in adults**, supporting the diagnosis. **Treat these as orientation, not as a rule**: sources describe the biochemical thresholds as imperfect, and a systematic review of biochemical testing exists precisely because performance varies. Where results are equivocal — raised transaminases, no Kayser–Fleischer rings, indeterminate caeruloplasmin and copper — **liver biopsy for hepatic copper concentration** is the arbiter, with penicillamine-provocation testing used in some centres.

**Safety/cost:** Requires a complete, correctly collected 24-hour sample in a **copper-free container** — incomplete collection is the commonest cause of a spurious result. Cheap otherwise.

> [!danger] **Do not ignore**
> **Wilson disease presenting as acute liver failure with a Coombs-negative haemolytic anaemia** — a recognised, rapidly fatal presentation, typically in a young person, requiring urgent transplant assessment. **A disproportionately low ALP relative to bilirubin** is a described clue.

**Normal/abnormal:** As above. **Caeruloplasmin is an acute-phase reactant** and can be falsely normal in inflammation, pregnancy or oestrogen use — a normal level does not exclude Wilson disease.

**Alt:** Slit-lamp examination for **Kayser–Fleischer rings**; serum caeruloplasmin and free copper; liver biopsy with quantitative copper; *ATP7B* genetic testing; MRI brain.

## 0.12 Urine Protein Electrophoresis (UPEP / Bence-Jones Protein)

**D:** Electrophoresis of urine with **immunofixation** to detect monoclonal **free light chains** — historically "Bence-Jones protein".

**Ind:** Suspected **multiple myeloma or related plasma cell disorder** — unexplained anaemia, bone pain or lytic lesions, hypercalcaemia, renal impairment, raised total protein or globulin gap, recurrent infection; and monitoring of known disease.

**Role:** Part of the myeloma screen alongside **serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), immunofixation, and serum free light chains**.

> [!warning] **Two technical points that decide whether the test works**
> **(1) Free light chains are not detected by urine dipstick** — the dipstick detects albumin. **A negative dipstick for protein does not exclude Bence-Jones proteinuria**, and this is the classic trap in light-chain-only myeloma presenting with renal failure.
> **(2) Specimen type matters** — sources describe a clean-catch early-morning sample for screening by UPEP/immunofixation, with a **24-hour collection preferred for quantification**. Sources also describe **serum free light chain assays reducing the need for urine testing**, and note algorithms using sFLC to rule out unnecessary Bence-Jones testing.

> [!danger] **Do not ignore**
> **Unexplained renal impairment with anaemia, hypercalcaemia or bone pain in an older patient** — screen for myeloma; **cast nephropathy from free light chains is a treatable cause of AKI where delay costs renal function.** Also request **calcium, ALP** and a skeletal survey or whole-body imaging as directed.

**Normal/abnormal:** No monoclonal band. A monoclonal band requires quantification, typing, and haematology referral. Note that a small monoclonal band may represent **MGUS**, which requires surveillance rather than treatment.

**Alt:** **Serum free light chain assay** (more sensitive, avoids collection problems); SPEP with immunofixation; quantitative immunoglobulins; bone marrow biopsy; imaging.

## 0.13 Fecal Incontinence

> [!warning] **Mis-filed and mis-categorised** — this is a **symptom**, not an investigation. Recorded here for traceability; the presentation-level differential belongs with the presentations axis. **UNRESOLVED — needs review:** confirm whether the build list intended an investigation (most likely **anorectal manometry** and **endoanal ultrasound**, both already built) and remove this row from the investigations list if so.

**Brief note — the investigations that answer it:** **anorectal manometry** (sphincter pressures, rectal sensation, RAIR — see `NEW_Investigations_Gastroenterology.md` 0.29); **endoanal/endorectal ultrasound** (structural sphincter defects, particularly obstetric injury — see 0.22–0.23 of the same file); **defecating proctography**; and **flexible sigmoidoscopy** to exclude a rectal lesion or inflammation. Also examine for **faecal impaction with overflow**, which is common, reversible, and the first thing to exclude — and in a patient with **new faecal incontinence plus saddle anaesthesia, leg weakness or urinary retention, consider cauda equina syndrome** and image the spine urgently.

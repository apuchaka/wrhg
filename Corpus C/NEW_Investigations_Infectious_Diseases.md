# NEW — Investigations: Infectious Diseases and Serology

> [!danger] **Sourcing limitation applying to this whole file.** Australian primary guideline domains are **egress-blocked** in this environment (verified 2026-08-30: 38 domains, `curl` and `WebFetch`, all 403 at the gateway); AMH and Therapeutic Guidelines are also subscription-gated. Entries are **snippet-sourced**. Numerics appear only on three-source agreement; where sources disagreed, or where a value is assay-dependent, the figure is **omitted and the omission stated in place**.

> [!warning] **Reference ranges and titre cut-offs are laboratory- and assay-specific throughout this file.** The interval or cut-off printed on the patient's own report is the one that applies. Where a threshold is omitted below, that is deliberate.

## 0.1 Gram Stain

**D:** Rapid microscopic stain separating bacteria by cell wall structure — **Gram-positive stain blue/purple, Gram-negative stain red/pink** — combined with morphology (cocci, bacilli) and arrangement (clusters, chains, diplococci).

**Ind:** Any specimen from a suspected bacterial infection where a same-hour answer changes management — CSF, joint aspirate, pleural or ascitic fluid, sputum, wound swab, positive blood culture bottles, urine in some settings.

**Role:** **Initial, not definitive.** Its value is speed: a result in under an hour, against 24–48h for culture. It narrows empirical therapy and, in CSF or joint fluid, can convert a suspicion into an immediate treatment decision.

**Safety/cost:** Cheap, non-invasive on an already-collected specimen. The risk sits entirely in the **collection** (lumbar puncture, joint aspiration), not the stain.

> [!danger] **Do not ignore**
> - **Organisms on CSF Gram stain** — bacterial meningitis; antibiotics immediately, and the result should be phoned.
> - **Organisms on joint aspirate** — septic arthritis until proven otherwise.
> - **Gram-positive cocci in clusters from blood cultures** — possible *S. aureus* bacteraemia, which is never a contaminant to be ignored and mandates source hunting and echocardiography consideration.
> - **Any organism from a normally sterile site.**

**Normal:** No organisms seen. In sputum, an assessment of specimen quality is reported alongside — **abundant squamous epithelial cells indicate oropharyngeal contamination and make the specimen uninterpretable**, which is the commonest reason a sputum result is worthless.

**Abnormal:** Report morphology and match to the likely organism — Gram-positive cocci in clusters (staphylococci), in chains (streptococci/enterococci), Gram-negative diplococci (*Neisseria*), Gram-negative bacilli (Enterobacterales, *Pseudomonas*), Gram-positive bacilli (*Listeria*, *Clostridium*). **A negative Gram stain does not exclude infection** — sensitivity is limited, particularly after antibiotics have been given.

**Alt:** Culture (definitive, gives susceptibilities); **PCR/NAAT** (more sensitive, unaffected by prior antibiotics, but gives no susceptibility data); MALDI-TOF on cultured isolates for rapid species identification.

## 0.2 Microbiology Panel (Wound Culture and Sensitivity)

**D:** Aerobic ± anaerobic culture of a wound, tissue or fluid specimen with antimicrobial susceptibility testing.

**Ind:** Clinically infected wound; failure of empirical therapy; suspected resistant organism; deep or surgical-site infection; osteomyelitis; any infection where targeted therapy will follow.

**Role:** **Gold standard for organism identification and susceptibility**, which is what distinguishes it from PCR. The specimen matters more than the test: **tissue or deep aspirate is far superior to a superficial swab**, which frequently grows colonising skin flora and misdirects therapy.

**Safety/cost:** Inexpensive; risk is in obtaining deep specimens. **Take cultures before antibiotics wherever it does not delay treatment of a septic patient** — the yield falls sharply afterwards.

> [!danger] **Do not ignore**
> Growth of a **multi-resistant organism** (MRSA, VRE, ESBL, CPE) — triggers infection-control isolation as well as a therapy change. **Anaerobes or mixed growth from a rapidly progressing soft tissue infection** — think necrotising infection and call surgery; do not wait for sensitivities.

**Normal:** No growth, or growth reported as normal skin/commensal flora. Sources describe **>10⁵ organisms per gram of tissue or per mL of aspirate** as the conventional quantitative threshold for wound infection; treat it as an aid, not a rule, and interpret with the clinical picture.

**Abnormal:** Identify organism and read the susceptibility panel. **Interpret "sensitive" against the site** — an antibiotic reported sensitive in vitro may not penetrate bone, CSF or abscess cavities. Mixed anaerobic/aerobic growth suggests a polymicrobial deep infection.

**Alt:** Gram stain (speed); 16S rRNA PCR or targeted NAAT where the patient is pre-treated with antibiotics; blood cultures; imaging for a collection needing drainage — **no antibiotic sterilises an undrained abscess**.

## 0.3 Viral Culture

**D:** Growth of virus in cell culture with identification by cytopathic effect or immunostaining.

**Ind:** Largely **historical in routine Australian practice** — displaced by PCR for almost every indication. Retains niche use where a viable isolate is needed: phenotypic antiviral resistance testing, novel or unsubtyped virus characterisation, reference and public health laboratory work.

**Role:** Neither initial nor gold standard in current practice. **PCR/NAAT has replaced it** on sensitivity and turnaround.

**Safety/cost:** Expensive, slow (days to weeks), requires specialised containment. Not available in most general laboratories.

**Normal/abnormal:** A negative culture has poor negative predictive value and **should not be used to exclude viral infection**.

**Alt:** **PCR/NAAT — the answer for essentially all clinical questions**; antigen detection; serology for exposure history rather than acute diagnosis.

## 0.4 Bacteroides

**D:** Culture and identification of *Bacteroides* species — **anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli**, dominant colonic flora, with *B. fragilis* the most clinically important.

**Ind:** Suspected anaerobic infection — intra-abdominal collection or perforation, pelvic abscess, aspiration pneumonia and lung abscess, diabetic foot and other deep soft tissue infection, brain abscess.

**Role:** Confirms an anaerobic component that empirical cover must address. Sources report *B. fragilis* in roughly half of closed post-operative wound infections with anaerobes, alongside *Prevotella* and *Fusobacterium* — and note that in most clinical infections **only *Bacteroides*, *Prevotella* and *Fusobacterium* need be considered** among the anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli.

**Safety/cost:** Requires **anaerobic transport medium and prompt delivery** — the commonest reason anaerobes are not isolated is that the specimen was handled aerobically. Swabs are poor; **pus or tissue in an anaerobic container** is what to send.

> [!warning] **The practical point.** Anaerobic infection is usually **polymicrobial**, foul-smelling, and often associated with gas in tissue. **A negative anaerobic culture does not exclude it** given how easily these organisms die in transit — so empirical anaerobic cover is often continued on clinical grounds regardless of the culture.

**Normal:** *Bacteroides* is normal gut flora; isolation from stool is meaningless. Significance comes from **isolation at a normally sterile site**.

**Abnormal:** Confirms anaerobic infection; look for the anatomical breach that let gut flora out. **Source control — drainage or debridement — is the treatment**; antibiotics alone are insufficient. **Specific agents are not named here**; Australian antibiotic guidance is egress-blocked and resistance in *B. fragilis* is a real and changing issue, so susceptibilities matter.

**Alt:** Gram stain; imaging to find the collection; 16S PCR in pre-treated patients.

## 0.5 Fusobacterium

**D:** Culture/identification of *Fusobacterium* species — anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli of the oropharyngeal and gut flora; ***F. necrophorum*** is the species that matters clinically.

**Ind:** Persistent or worsening sore throat with systemic illness; suspected **Lemierre's syndrome**; septic pulmonary emboli of unclear source; periodontal, head and neck, or brain abscess.

**Role:** Confirmatory rather than initial — **Lemierre's is a clinical and radiological diagnosis** and treatment must not wait for anaerobic culture, which is slow.

> [!danger] **Do not ignore**
> ***Fusobacterium* in blood cultures from a young patient with a recent sore throat, unilateral neck pain and swinging fever is Lemierre's syndrome** — internal jugular septic thrombophlebitis with septic emboli, most often pulmonary. It requires urgent imaging of the neck veins and the chest, and prolonged antibiotics. It is a young, previously well person's disease and is missed because the sore throat has usually been dismissed.

**Normal:** Oropharyngeal commensal; isolation from a throat swab does not establish disease.

**Abnormal:** Isolation from blood or a sterile site establishes invasive disease. Look for the primary oropharyngeal source and for metastatic emboli.

**Alt:** **CT or ultrasound of the neck** for internal jugular thrombosis; CT chest for septic emboli; blood cultures (the usual route to the diagnosis).

## 0.6 Enterococcus spp.

**D:** Culture/identification of enterococci — **Gram-positive cocci in chains**, gut commensals; *E. faecalis* and *E. faecium* predominate.

**Ind:** Isolation from urine, blood, intra-abdominal collections, or heart valves; VRE colonisation screening in hospital infection control.

**Role:** Identification is straightforward; the value of the report is the **susceptibility panel**, because the organism's intrinsic resistance profile is the whole clinical problem.

> [!warning] **Intrinsic resistance is the fact to carry.** Enterococci are **intrinsically resistant to cephalosporins** — sources attribute this to penicillin-binding proteins with low reactivity toward cephalosporins. **Practical consequence: a patient on a cephalosporin can develop enterococcal superinfection**, and an intra-abdominal or urinary infection treated with a cephalosporin alone leaves enterococci untreated. They are also intrinsically resistant to aminoglycosides at standard doses (though synergy is used in endocarditis) and to co-trimoxazole in vivo despite in-vitro susceptibility.

**Safety/cost:** Routine culture. **VRE screening** (usually rectal swab or stool) is an infection-control test, not a diagnostic one — a positive screen means colonisation and isolation precautions, not infection.

> [!danger] **Do not ignore**
> **Enterococcal bacteraemia** — search for a source and **consider infective endocarditis**, for which enterococci are a recognised cause; echocardiography is usually indicated. **VRE isolation** — immediate infection-control implications for the ward.

**Normal:** Gut and perineal commensal. Isolation from a superficial wound or a catheter urine specimen in an asymptomatic patient often represents colonisation, not infection.

**Abnormal:** Interpret against the site and the patient. **Distinguish colonisation from infection before treating** — this is the commonest error with this organism.

**Alt:** Blood cultures; echocardiography; PCR-based VRE screening (faster than culture for infection control).

## 0.7 Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacterales (CPE Screening)

**D:** Screening for Enterobacterales carrying carbapenemase genes, by **culture on selective media, PCR for resistance genes, or both**.

**Ind:** Infection-control screening of patients at risk — **hospitalisation or a healthcare procedure overseas**, transfer from a high-prevalence unit, previous CPE, or contact with a known case. Also on any carbapenem-resistant isolate from a clinical specimen.

**Role:** Primarily a **public health and infection-control test**, not a diagnostic one. It determines isolation and contact tracing.

**Safety/cost:** Non-invasive (rectal swab or stool). Sources note the trade-off directly: **culture is labour-intensive and slow but confirms viable organism and gives susceptibilities; PCR is fast but detects the gene, which does not always equate to a phenotypically resistant, clinically significant organism.** Algorithms using culture, PCR, or both in sequence are all in use.

> [!danger] **Do not ignore**
> A positive CPE screen requires **immediate contact precautions and notification of the infection-control team**, regardless of whether the patient is infected. These organisms leave very few therapeutic options, and containment is the main defence.

**Normal:** No carbapenemase detected — but **a negative screen does not exclude carriage**, particularly after recent antibiotics or with low-level colonisation, so repeat screening is used in high-risk patients.

**Abnormal:** Positive screen = colonisation. **Colonisation is not infection and is not itself treated.** If the patient becomes infected, therapy is a specialist infectious-diseases decision.

**Alt:** Phenotypic confirmatory tests on the isolate; whole-genome sequencing for outbreak investigation.

## 0.8 Candida albicans (Fungal Culture, Microscopy, Beta-D-Glucan)

**D:** Identification of *Candida* by **microscopy (yeasts, pseudohyphae), culture**, or the non-culture serum marker **(1,3)-β-D-glucan**.

**Ind:** Suspected mucosal candidiasis (oral, oesophageal, vulvovaginal); suspected invasive candidiasis in the at-risk patient — ICU stay, central venous catheter, broad-spectrum antibiotics, abdominal surgery, parenteral nutrition, neutropenia.

**Role:** Superficial disease is usually a **clinical diagnosis**; swabs confirm and speciate. For **invasive** disease, blood culture is the reference standard but performs poorly — sources report sensitivity for autopsy-proven invasive candidiasis in the range of roughly **21–71%**, which is the central problem. **β-D-glucan is used mainly to *exclude* invasive fungal infection**, with high sensitivity and negative predictive value; it is **not specific to *Candida*** and also rises with *Aspergillus*, *Pneumocystis* and *Fusarium*.

**Safety/cost:** Swabs and cultures cheap; β-D-glucan is a send-away with cost and turnaround implications, and has recognised **false positives** (haemodialysis with certain membranes, immunoglobulin or albumin infusion, some antibiotics, gauze contamination).

> [!danger] **Do not ignore**
> ***Candida* in a blood culture is never a contaminant.** It mandates treatment, **removal or exchange of central venous catheters**, and **dilated fundoscopy to look for endophthalmitis** — an examination frequently omitted, and one that changes the duration and choice of therapy.

**Normal:** *Candida* is normal oral, gut and vaginal flora; isolation from those sites without symptoms means nothing. **Candiduria in a catheterised patient is usually colonisation.**

**Abnormal:** Speciate — **non-*albicans* species carry differing azole susceptibility**, so speciation changes the drug. **No antifungal doses are stated here**; Australian antifungal guidance is egress-blocked.

**Alt:** Blood cultures; T2Candida and PCR assays; tissue histopathology (definitive for invasive disease); imaging for deep foci.

## 0.9 Stool & Fecal Studies (Culture, Multiplex PCR, Ova/Cysts/Parasites, Faecal Calprotectin, FOBT/FIT)

**D:** A family of tests on faeces: **bacterial culture**, **faecal multiplex PCR** for bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens, **microscopy for ova, cysts and parasites (OCP)**, **faecal calprotectin** (an inflammatory marker), and **FOBT/FIT** (occult blood).

**Ind:** Sources are explicit that **most infectious diarrhoea is mild, self-limiting and needs no microbiological testing** — supportive rehydration is sufficient. Test when: severe illness, bloody diarrhoea, systemic toxicity, immunosuppression or significant comorbidity, prolonged symptoms, recent travel, an outbreak or public-health concern, recent antibiotics or hospitalisation (*C. difficile*), or a food-handler/childcare occupation.

**Role:** **Multiplex PCR has largely replaced culture** for pathogen detection on speed and sensitivity, and detects viral causes that culture misses entirely — important because viruses cause much of the paediatric burden. **Culture is still needed where an isolate is required** for susceptibility testing or public-health typing. **OCP microscopy must be specifically requested** and is indicated in returned travellers, agricultural exposure and prolonged symptoms — write the history on the request form.

**Safety/cost:** Non-invasive. Multiplex PCR is more expensive per test but reduces repeat testing. Its main drawback is **detection of organisms that may be colonising rather than causative**, which requires clinical judgement.

> [!danger] **Do not ignore**
> **Bloody diarrhoea with acute kidney injury and a falling platelet count** — consider Shiga toxin-producing *E. coli* and **haemolytic uraemic syndrome**; see [[08_10_Infectious_Disease_-_Diarrhoea_DDx_and_Gastroenteritis]] and [[15_11_Paeds_-_Urological_and_Renal_Anomalies__Wilms_Tumour__HUS]]. **Antibiotics and antimotility agents are avoided** where STEC is suspected.
> ***C. difficile* toxin positive** in a patient on antibiotics — stop the precipitant where possible, isolate, and treat.

**Normal:** No pathogen detected. **Faecal calprotectin** distinguishes inflammatory from functional bowel disease — a low result argues strongly against active IBD and supports IBS, avoiding colonoscopy; **the numeric cut-off is deliberately omitted, being assay-specific and not confirmable to three sources here.**

**Abnormal:** Match organism to syndrome and to public-health notification requirements. **FIT positivity** is a bowel-cancer screening result requiring colonoscopy, not an infection result — see [[19_General_Practice_and_Preventive_Medicine]] for the screening programme.

**Alt:** Blood cultures if systemically septic; sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy where IBD or ischaemic colitis is likely; imaging for complications.

## 0.10 Cryptosporidium

**D:** Detection of *Cryptosporidium* oocysts by **stool antigen EIA, PCR (usually within a multiplex panel), or modified acid-fast microscopy**.

**Ind:** Watery diarrhoea that is prolonged or severe, especially with **recreational water or swimming pool exposure, contact with farm animals or calves, childcare outbreaks, or travel**; and — critically — **any diarrhoea in an immunocompromised patient**.

**Role:** Targeted test. **Routine stool microscopy will miss it unless specifically requested** — it does not stain with standard methods, which is the single most useful practical point.

**Safety/cost:** Non-invasive. Now usually captured within faecal multiplex PCR panels.

> [!danger] **Do not ignore**
> **Cryptosporidiosis in advanced HIV or other severe T-cell immunodeficiency** can cause **prolonged, profuse, life-threatening diarrhoea and biliary tract disease**. It is a marker of significant immunosuppression — check HIV status and CD4 count if not known.

**Normal:** Not detected.

**Abnormal:** In the immunocompetent it is self-limiting over days to weeks and managed supportively. In the immunocompromised, **immune reconstitution is the definitive treatment** (antiretroviral therapy in HIV). It is a **notifiable disease** in Australian jurisdictions and has public-health implications for pools and water supplies — exclude affected people from swimming for a period after symptoms resolve (**the exclusion period is jurisdiction-specific and is not stated here**).

**Alt:** Faecal multiplex PCR; duodenal biopsy in the immunocompromised with negative stools.

## 0.11 Giardia lamblia

**D:** Detection of *Giardia* by **stool antigen EIA, PCR, or microscopy for cysts/trophozoites**.

**Ind:** Prolonged diarrhoea with **bloating, flatulence, foul-smelling greasy stools, weight loss** and no fever; travel to endemic areas; camping and untreated water; childcare and household contacts; men who have sex with men.

**Role:** Antigen detection and PCR outperform microscopy. **Microscopy has poor sensitivity on a single specimen** because excretion is intermittent — the classical answer is **three specimens on separate days**, though PCR-based panels have largely removed the need.

**Safety/cost:** Non-invasive, inexpensive.

**Normal:** Not detected. **A single negative microscopy does not exclude giardiasis** — this is the trap.

**Abnormal:** Confirms infection; treat, and treat symptomatic household contacts. Consider **secondary lactose intolerance**, which commonly follows and explains symptoms persisting after successful eradication — a genuinely useful point when a patient "fails" treatment. **Antimicrobial agent and dose are not stated here** (Australian guidance egress-blocked).

**Alt:** Faecal multiplex PCR; duodenal aspirate/biopsy in refractory cases; consider **coeliac serology** in persistent malabsorptive symptoms (see 0.18).

## 0.12 HIV Panel (Fourth-Generation Antigen/Antibody Screen, HIV RNA Viral Load)

**D:** **Fourth-generation combined assay** detecting HIV antibody **and p24 antigen**, plus **HIV RNA (viral load)** by NAAT for diagnosis in the window period and for monitoring.

**Ind:** Diagnostic testing on clinical suspicion — including **any acute seroconversion illness** (fever, rash, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, mononucleosis-like); routine screening in antenatal care, at STI checks, in TB and hepatitis diagnosis, and in blood/tissue donation; after occupational or non-occupational exposure; and as part of the work-up of unexplained immunosuppression.

**Role:** Fourth-generation assay is the **initial screening test** in Australia and other high-income settings, using highly sensitive antigen/antibody sandwich technology. Sources state that **Western blot is currently the standard confirmatory assay used in Australia** — noting that many other countries have moved to alternative confirmatory algorithms (see 0.13).

> [!warning] **The window period, and the second window.** Sources give the fourth-generation window as approximately **18–45 days**, with about **45 days required to detect 99%** of infections. There is also a described **"second diagnostic window"** — a period of assay non-reactivity after the p24 antigen falls below detection but before antibody becomes reactive, reported as lasting **up to about 28 days**. **In both windows the answer is HIV NAAT (RNA or proviral DNA), not a repeat serology.**
> Because sources vary on the precise window boundaries, treat these as approximate and **repeat testing at the interval your local protocol specifies** after a significant exposure.

**Safety/cost:** Venepuncture only. **Consent and pre-/post-test discussion** are part of the test — a positive result has major personal consequences, and Australian practice requires the result be given in person by someone able to arrange immediate linkage to care.

> [!danger] **Do not ignore**
> A **reactive screen must never be given to a patient as a diagnosis before confirmatory testing** — false positives occur, and the consequences of a wrong result are severe. Equally, **a negative screen in someone with a compelling acute seroconversion picture does not exclude HIV** — request NAAT.

**Normal:** Non-reactive. Report with the caveat about window periods where recent exposure is possible.

**Abnormal:** Reactive screen → confirmatory testing → if confirmed, **baseline viral load, CD4 count, resistance genotype, hepatitis B and C serology, syphilis serology, and screening for other STIs and TB**, with urgent referral. See [[08_08_Infectious_Disease_-_Genitourinary_Infections_and_STIs]].

**Alt:** Point-of-care rapid tests (useful for reach and speed; **all reactive results require laboratory confirmation**); HIV NAAT for the window period; CD4 count for staging, not diagnosis.

## 0.13 Western Blot

**D:** Immunoblot separating viral proteins by electrophoresis and detecting antibody against individual bands.

**Ind:** **Confirmatory testing after a reactive HIV screening immunoassay** — sources identify it as the current standard confirmatory assay in Australia. Historically also used for Lyme disease confirmation.

**Role:** **Confirmatory, never a screening test.** It is a first-generation technology retained for its specificity.

**Safety/cost:** Labour-intensive, slow, and expensive relative to modern alternatives; performed in reference laboratories.

> [!warning] **Its known weakness is early infection.** Because it detects antibody only, **Western blot can be negative or indeterminate during seroconversion when the fourth-generation screen is already reactive on the p24 antigen** — precisely the situation in acute HIV. An **indeterminate** result therefore requires **HIV NAAT and repeat serology**, not reassurance. This assay-generation mismatch is the main reason other countries have moved to antigen/antibody differentiation assays plus NAAT.

**Normal:** Negative — no bands, or bands below the criteria for reactivity.

**Abnormal:** Positive confirms infection. **Indeterminate** requires the follow-up above and is the result most likely to be mishandled.

**Alt:** HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay; **HIV NAAT** — faster, and positive earlier.

## 0.14 Syphilis Panel (Treponemal EIA/CMIA, RPR, VDRL, TPPA/FTA-ABS)

**D:** Two classes of test used together: **treponemal** (EIA/CMIA, TPPA, FTA-ABS — detect antibody to *T. pallidum*, usually **positive for life** after infection) and **non-treponemal** (**RPR, VDRL** — detect non-specific reagin, reported as a **quantitative titre**, and fall with successful treatment).

**Ind:** STI screening; antenatal screening; any genital ulcer, unexplained rash (**especially palms and soles**), unexplained neurological or ophthalmic disease; HIV diagnosis; blood donation.

**Role:** Modern laboratories use the **reverse-sequence algorithm**: a treponemal immunoassay first, reflexing to a **quantitative RPR**, with a second treponemal test (**TPPA**) as tiebreaker when the two disagree.

> [!info] **Interpreting the combinations** (three-source agreement on the pattern)
> | EIA | RPR | TPPA | Interpretation |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | Reactive | Reactive | Reactive | Syphilis infection — stage clinically; if previously treated with a **falling** titre, consistent with treated disease |
> | Reactive | Non-reactive | Reactive | **Past, successfully treated syphilis** (or very early, or late latent) |
> | Reactive | Non-reactive | Non-reactive | **False-positive screen** |
> | Non-reactive | — | — | No serological evidence of syphilis — but does not exclude very early primary infection |

> [!warning] **Titres, not positives, are what you follow.** RPR/VDRL must be reported quantitatively (1:2, 1:4, 1:8…). **A four-fold change is the meaningful unit** — a four-fold fall indicates treatment response, a four-fold rise suggests reinfection or treatment failure. Some patients remain **"serofast"** — a persistent low titre for life despite adequate treatment — and this is not failure. **Always compare against the same laboratory's previous titre.**
> **Biological false-positive RPR** occurs in pregnancy, autoimmune disease (especially antiphospholipid syndrome), acute infection including EBV, IV drug use and older age.

> [!danger] **Do not ignore**
> **Syphilis in pregnancy** — congenital syphilis is preventable and devastating; treatment is time-critical. **Any neurological, ophthalmic or otological symptom in a patient with syphilis** — neurosyphilis can occur at any stage and requires CSF examination and different treatment.

**Normal:** Non-reactive treponemal screen.

**Abnormal:** Stage the infection clinically, treat, **notify and trace contacts**, and **test for other STIs including HIV**. **Regimens are not stated here** — Australian STI guidelines are egress-blocked and stage-specific.

**Alt:** **Dark-field microscopy** and lesion PCR for primary chancre (marked `[CUT]` on the build list, noted here only for completeness); CSF examination for neurosyphilis.

## 0.15 Monospot (Heterophile Antibody Test)

**D:** Latex/slide agglutination detecting **heterophile antibodies** produced in acute EBV infection.

**Ind:** Suspected infectious mononucleosis — sore throat, fever, marked cervical (especially posterior) lymphadenopathy, fatigue, splenomegaly.

**Role:** **Initial, rapid and cheap**, but with an important sensitivity profile.

> [!warning] **False negatives are common and predictable.** Sources give a consistent pattern: negative in around **25% in the first week** of illness, **5–10% in the second**, and **~5% in the third**; and it performs poorly **in children under about 4 years**, in whom heterophile antibodies are often simply not produced. **A negative Monospot early, or in a young child, does not exclude glandular fever** — request EBV-specific serology.

**Safety/cost:** Cheap, rapid, minimal blood volume.

> [!danger] **Do not ignore**
> **Splenomegaly** — advise avoidance of contact sport and heavy lifting because of splenic rupture risk (**the duration of avoidance is not stated here; sources differ**). **Stridor, drooling or airway compromise** from tonsillar hypertrophy is an airway emergency. **A morbilliform rash after amoxicillin** in this setting is the classic association and is not a penicillin allergy.

**Normal:** Negative — interpret against duration of illness and age as above.

**Abnormal:** Positive supports acute EBV. **FBC and film typically show lymphocytosis with atypical/reactive lymphocytes**; LFTs are commonly mildly deranged. Note that heterophile antibodies are also implicated in **false-positive treponemal syphilis serology**, a documented cross-reaction.

**Alt:** **EBV-specific serology (VCA IgM/IgG, EBNA)** — the test when Monospot is negative but suspicion persists; sources support VCA IgM plus transient early-antigen antibody as diagnostic of acute infection in heterophile-negative serum. **Consider the mononucleosis-like differentials — CMV, acute HIV, toxoplasmosis, adenovirus** — which specific serology distinguishes and which Monospot cannot.

## 0.16 Parvovirus Serology (Parvovirus B19 IgM and IgG)

**D:** Serology for parvovirus B19 — the cause of **erythema infectiosum (fifth disease, "slapped cheek")**.

**Ind:** Rash illness in a child or adult; **acute symmetrical arthropathy**, especially in adult women; **exposure in pregnancy**; **transient aplastic crisis** in a patient with a haemolytic anaemia; unexplained anaemia in the immunocompromised.

**Role:** Serology is the initial test in the immunocompetent. **PCR is preferred in pregnancy for fetal assessment and in the immunocompromised**, who may not mount an antibody response.

> [!info] **Interpretation** (source-supported)
> | IgM | IgG | Interpretation |
> |---|---|---|
> | Negative | Positive | **Past infection — immune, no fetal risk** |
> | Positive | Positive | **Infection within roughly the last 7–120 days — possible fetal risk if pregnant** |
> | Positive | Negative | Very recent infection |
> | Negative | Negative | Susceptible — repeat if recent exposure |
>
> IgM becomes detectable around **10–12 days** after infection and may persist **3–4 months or longer**; IgG persists for life.

> [!danger] **Do not ignore**
> **Parvovirus exposure or infection in pregnancy** — risks include **fetal anaemia, hydrops fetalis and miscarriage**, and confirmed maternal infection requires **serial fetal ultrasound with middle cerebral artery Doppler** surveillance under obstetric care. **Aplastic crisis** in sickle cell disease or hereditary spherocytosis — a sudden severe anaemia with an inappropriately **low reticulocyte count**, which is the discriminating finding.

**Normal:** IgG positive/IgM negative in a large share of adults — immunity, and reassuring in pregnancy.

**Abnormal:** Acute infection in pregnancy → obstetric referral. In the immunocompromised → **parvovirus PCR**, since serology is unreliable.

**Alt:** **Parvovirus B19 PCR** (blood, or amniotic fluid in fetal assessment); FBC and reticulocyte count where aplastic crisis is suspected — see 0.1 of [[NEW_Investigations_Haematology]].

## 0.17 ASOT (Anti-Streptolysin O Titre) and Anti-DNase B

**D:** Antibody titres against streptococcal exotoxins — evidence of **recent** group A streptococcal infection, not current infection.

**Ind:** Suspected **acute rheumatic fever**, **post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis**, or post-streptococcal reactive arthritis — where the streptococcal infection has usually resolved by the time the complication presents.

**Role:** Supportive evidence of antecedent infection. **Neither test diagnoses acute pharyngitis** — throat swab culture or PCR does that.

> [!warning] **Which test to order depends on the site of the preceding infection, and this is the high-yield point.** Sources agree that **after skin infection (impetigo/pyoderma) ASOT is unreliable and anti-DNase B is the test to use.** ASOT responds well after pharyngitis. **Ordering both increases sensitivity**, and this matters in Australia because post-streptococcal complications following **skin** infection are a major issue in remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.

> [!info] **Sensitivity** — sources report elevated ASOT in **over 80%** of acute rheumatic fever and around **95%** of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis; conversely, roughly **15%** of rheumatic fever cases have a normal ASOT. **A normal titre does not exclude the diagnosis.**

**Safety/cost:** Venepuncture; inexpensive.

**Normal:** **Numeric cut-offs are deliberately omitted** — they are laboratory- and age-dependent (titres are higher in school-aged children), and no single figure met the three-source bar. **Paired sera showing a rising titre are far more informative than a single result** interpreted against a population cut-off.

**Abnormal:** A raised or rising titre supports recent streptococcal infection. **It does not by itself diagnose rheumatic fever** — that is a clinical diagnosis against defined criteria, with an Australian-specific high-risk stratification; see [[08_01-03_Infectious_Disease_-_Bacterial_Infections]] and [[01_Cardiovascular]] 0.22 Rheumatic Fever.

**Alt:** Throat swab culture/PCR (for current infection); skin swab; ECG and echocardiography where rheumatic fever is suspected; urinalysis, UEC and complement (**low C3**) where post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is suspected.

## 0.18 Coeliac Serology (Anti-tTG IgA, Deamidated Gliadin Peptide IgA/IgG)

**D:** Antibody testing for coeliac disease — **anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA (tTG-IgA)** as the primary test, with **total serum IgA** measured at the same time, and **DGP-IgG / tTG-IgG** where IgA is deficient.

**Ind:** Chronic diarrhoea or malabsorption; **iron deficiency anaemia**, especially unexplained or refractory; unexplained weight loss; faltering growth in children; osteoporosis at a young age; unexplained transaminitis; **dermatitis herpetiformis**; first-degree relatives; type 1 diabetes and autoimmune thyroid disease.

**Role:** **tTG-IgA is the first-line serological test.** Duodenal biopsy remains the diagnostic gold standard in adults.

> [!danger] **Two errors that invalidate the test, both common**
> **(1) Total IgA must be measured with it.** Sources are consistent: **tTG-IgA is falsely low in IgA deficiency**, which affects around **2%** of people with coeliac disease. If IgA is deficient, reflex to **tTG-IgG and/or DGP-IgG**, which are unaffected.
> **(2) The patient must be eating gluten.** Serology and histology **normalise on a gluten-free diet**, so testing someone who has already excluded gluten produces a false negative and leaves them without a diagnosis — with lifelong consequences for screening, family testing and access to support. **Test before advising dietary change.**

**Safety/cost:** Venepuncture. Biopsy carries endoscopy risks.

**Normal:** Negative tTG-IgA with normal total IgA makes coeliac disease unlikely — **provided gluten was being eaten.**

**Abnormal:** Positive serology → **gastroenterology referral for duodenal biopsy** while still on gluten. **A specific antibody titre threshold for proceeding without biopsy is deliberately omitted** — paediatric no-biopsy pathways exist but the threshold is expressed as a multiple of an assay-specific upper limit and is guideline-dependent. See [[03_Gastrointestinal]] Coeliac Disease.

**Alt:** Duodenal biopsy (gold standard); HLA-DQ2/DQ8 — useful for its **negative** predictive value, since absence makes coeliac disease very unlikely, but a positive is common in the general population and does not diagnose.

## 0.19 Autoimmune / Rheumatological Serology (ANA, Anti-La/SSB, Anti-Scl-70, Anti-histone, Myositis Antibodies)

**D:** Panel of autoantibodies used to characterise connective tissue disease, usually beginning with **ANA** and reflexing to **extractable nuclear antigen (ENA)** specificities.

**Ind:** Clinical features suggesting connective tissue disease — inflammatory arthritis, photosensitive rash, serositis, Raynaud phenomenon, sicca symptoms, unexplained cytopenias, unexplained renal or interstitial lung disease, proximal myopathy.

**Role:** **Supportive, never diagnostic alone.** These are tests to order when a clinical syndrome already suggests the diagnosis.

> [!danger] **ANA is a poor screening test in an unselected patient, and this is the single most consequential point.** A low-titre positive ANA is common in **healthy people** — more so with increasing age and in women — and in other conditions entirely. Ordering ANA on non-specific fatigue or widespread pain generates false positives, anxiety and unnecessary referral. **Order it against a clinical question, not as a screen.**

> [!info] **Specificities worth associating**
> - **Anti-dsDNA, anti-Sm** — SLE (dsDNA titre can track disease activity, particularly renal).
> - **Anti-Ro/SSA, anti-La/SSB** — Sjögren syndrome; **anti-Ro also matters in pregnancy** because of the risk of congenital heart block and neonatal lupus.
> - **Anti-Scl-70 (topoisomerase I)** — diffuse systemic sclerosis, associated with interstitial lung disease.
> - **Anti-centromere** — limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis/CREST.
> - **Anti-histone** — **drug-induced lupus** (a pattern relevant to hydralazine, procainamide, isoniazid and others).
> - **Myositis antibodies (anti-Jo-1 and the antisynthetases, anti-Mi-2, anti-SRP, anti-MDA5)** — inflammatory myopathies; **anti-Jo-1 with the antisynthetase syndrome** (myositis, interstitial lung disease, mechanic's hands, Raynaud, arthritis) and **anti-MDA5** with rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease and relatively little muscle involvement.

**Safety/cost:** Venepuncture; panels are expensive and frequently over-ordered.

**Normal:** Negative ANA makes SLE unlikely but does not exclude every connective tissue disease.

**Abnormal:** Interpret **titre and pattern** with the clinical picture, and refer. See [[12_03_Rheum_-_Connective_Tissue_Diseases__SLE__Systemic_Sclerosis__Dermatomyositis__Polymyositis__Sjogren_]].

**Alt:** Complement C3/C4; inflammatory markers; organ-specific assessment (urinalysis and UPCR, CK, pulmonary function tests, high-resolution CT chest); biopsy.

## 0.20 Positive Autoimmune Serology (approach to an unexpected positive)

**D:** Not a test — the **clinical problem of an autoantibody result returned positive without a matching clinical syndrome**, most often an incidentally ordered ANA or rheumatoid factor.

**Ind:** Applies whenever such a result lands.

**Role:** The task is to decide whether this is disease, a marker of risk, or noise.

> [!warning] **The approach, in order**
> 1. **Why was it ordered?** If there was no clinical question, the pre-test probability was low and the post-test probability of disease remains low — **Bayes, not the assay, is the issue.**
> 2. **What is the titre?** Low-titre ANA is frequently a normal finding; higher titres carry more weight but still need a syndrome.
> 3. **Is there a pattern or specificity?** A positive ANA with a negative ENA and negative dsDNA in an asymptomatic person is usually not disease.
> 4. **Is there organ involvement?** Examine, and check **urinalysis, FBC, creatinine, LFTs and inflammatory markers** — cheap tests that find the disease if it is there.
> 5. **Are there confounders?** Age, infection (EBV, hepatitis C), drugs, malignancy, and other autoimmune disease all produce positives.
> 6. **If all negative:** document, explain to the patient, and **arrange clinical review rather than serial re-testing** — repeating the antibody adds nothing.

> [!danger] **Do not ignore**
> A positive result **with** a clinical syndrome. The failure mode runs both ways: over-investigating an asymptomatic positive, and dismissing a positive in someone who genuinely has rash, arthritis, serositis or renal involvement. **The result is only as good as the question that generated it.**

**Alt:** Nothing further, in most cases — **the correct next test is often no test**, plus a clinical review interval.

## 0.21 Vasculitis Serology (ANCA, PR3, MPO, Anti-GBM)

**D:** **ANCA** by antigen-specific immunoassay for **PR3** and **MPO**, with indirect immunofluorescence (cANCA/pANCA patterns) in some laboratories; and **anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM)** antibody.

**Ind:** Suspected small-vessel vasculitis — **rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis**, pulmonary haemorrhage, pulmonary–renal syndrome, mononeuritis multiplex, unexplained multisystem illness with constitutional symptoms, chronic destructive upper airway disease, palpable purpura.

**Role:** **Sensitive and specific markers for ANCA-associated vasculitis**; sources note the 2017 international consensus supports **primary use of PR3- and MPO-specific immunoassays without categorically requiring immunofluorescence**. **Anti-GBM is highly specific** for anti-GBM disease (formerly Goodpasture).

> [!danger] **This is one of the few serology requests that is an emergency.**
> **Suspected pulmonary–renal syndrome — haemoptysis with acute kidney injury and an active urinary sediment — needs same-day nephrology/rheumatology involvement, and the serology should be phoned through.** Treatment (immunosuppression, and plasma exchange in anti-GBM disease) is time-critical and delay costs renal function irreversibly. **Do not wait for serology to make the referral.**
> **Both ANCA and anti-GBM can be positive together** — a documented dual-positive phenotype with a worse prognosis, and a reason to send both rather than one.

**Safety/cost:** Venepuncture. **Renal biopsy** — the usual definitive step — carries bleeding risk and requires coagulation screening and a platelet count first.

**Normal:** Negative ANCA does not exclude vasculitis; a proportion of patients with clinically definite disease are ANCA-negative, particularly with limited/localised forms.

**Abnormal:** **PR3-ANCA** associates with granulomatosis with polyangiitis; **MPO-ANCA** with microscopic polyangiitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis — associations, not equivalences. Confirm with **biopsy** wherever feasible before committing to long-term immunosuppression. Beware **drug-induced ANCA vasculitis** — hydralazine, propylthiouracil, cocaine/levamisole. See [[12_04_Rheum_-_Vasculitis]].

**Alt:** Urinalysis with microscopy for casts (**the cheapest and fastest test in this presentation, and it must be done**); UEC and urine protein:creatinine ratio; CXR and CT chest; renal or other tissue biopsy; complement, cryoglobulins and hepatitis serology for the mimics.

## 0.22 Campylobacter (Stool Culture / Multiplex PCR)

**D:** Detection of ***Campylobacter jejuni*** (and *C. coli*) in stool by **culture on selective media at 42 °C in a microaerophilic atmosphere**, or — now more commonly and much faster — as part of a **multiplex gastrointestinal PCR panel**.

**Ind:** Acute diarrhoea, particularly **bloody or febrile diarrhoea**, or diarrhoea that is severe, prolonged (beyond about a week), in an immunocompromised or elderly patient, in a returned traveller, or occurring in a cluster or in a food handler, childcare or healthcare worker.

**Role:** ***Campylobacter* is the commonest bacterial cause of gastroenteritis in Australia**, and is **notifiable in every jurisdiction** — so the test serves public health surveillance and outbreak detection as well as the individual patient.

> [!warning] **The result rarely changes treatment for the individual, and that is the point to understand.** Most campylobacter enteritis is **self-limiting and managed with rehydration alone**. Antibiotics — sources name **azithromycin** as the agent of choice, with a short course, and note **high fluoroquinolone resistance** (particularly in South-East Asian isolates) — are reserved for **severe, prolonged, bloody or febrile illness, immunosuppression, pregnancy, or extremes of age.** Treating everyone who tests positive is not indicated.

> [!danger] **Do not ignore**
> - ***Campylobacter* is the commonest identified antecedent infection in GUILLAIN-BARRÉ SYNDROME**, through molecular mimicry between bacterial lipo-oligosaccharide and human gangliosides. Sources report roughly **1 in 1,000–5,000 infections is followed by GBS, typically 1–3 weeks later.** **New ascending weakness or areflexia after a diarrhoeal illness is GBS until proven otherwise** — it needs serial **FVC** measurement and urgent neurology input, not reassurance. See [[04_Neurology]].
> - **Reactive arthritis** is the other post-infectious sequela.
> - **Antimotility agents (loperamide) are avoided in bloody or febrile diarrhoea** — they prolong exposure and are associated with complications in invasive infection.
> - **Notify, and ask about the exposure**: undercooked poultry, unpasteurised milk, untreated water, and contact with animals. Food handlers, childcare and healthcare workers have **exclusion requirements** set by the state health department.
> - **A positive PCR does not distinguish live from dead organism** and can stay positive after clinical recovery — do not re-test for clearance unless public health requires it.

**Normal/abnormal:** Organism detected or not detected; culture additionally gives susceptibilities, which matter when treatment is needed.

**Alt:** Stool culture for other pathogens and multiplex panel (0.9); blood cultures where there is systemic illness (bacteraemia occurs, particularly in the immunosuppressed); faecal calprotectin and endoscopy where inflammatory bowel disease is the alternative diagnosis; serology in suspected post-infectious GBS is not used diagnostically.

## 0.23 *Clostridium perfringens* (Stool Toxin Detection, and Tissue Diagnosis in Gas Gangrene)

**D:** **Two entirely different clinical entities share this organism, and they require different tests.**
1. **Food-poisoning diarrhoea:** detection of ***C. perfringens* enterotoxin (CPE) in stool by ELISA**, with quantitative stool culture — usually done for **outbreak investigation** rather than for an individual patient.
2. **Clostridial myonecrosis (gas gangrene) and necrotising soft tissue infection:** **Gram stain and culture of tissue taken at surgery**, with imaging showing soft tissue gas.

**Ind:** **Outbreak investigation** of a cluster of short-lived diarrhoea and cramps after a shared meal; and, quite separately, **suspected necrotising soft tissue infection**.

**Role:** In the food-poisoning form, the test is **epidemiological**. In myonecrosis, the diagnosis is **clinical and surgical** — the laboratory confirms it afterwards.

> [!info] **The food-poisoning syndrome is characteristic and self-limiting.** Sources describe **type A** strains as responsible for most *C. perfringens* food poisoning, classically from **improperly cooled or reheated meat, poultry and gravy** — the "cafeteria germ". Spores survive cooking, germinate as food cools slowly, and enterotoxin is produced in the gut. **Watery diarrhoea and cramps WITHOUT prominent vomiting or fever, beginning about 6–24 hours after the meal and settling within about 24 hours.** Treatment is **rehydration only — antibiotics are not indicated.**

> [!danger] **CLOSTRIDIAL MYONECROSIS (GAS GANGRENE) IS A SURGICAL EMERGENCY AND THE ONLY TREATMENT THAT WORKS IS DEBRIDEMENT.**
> - **Recognise it: PAIN OUT OF PROPORTION to the visible findings** is the earliest and most important sign, with rapid progression over hours, systemic toxicity out of keeping with local appearances, tense oedema, bronze or dusky discolouration, bullae, a thin "dishwater" discharge, and **crepitus or gas on imaging (which is a late sign — its absence excludes nothing)**.
> - **Do not wait for imaging or laboratory confirmation.** Resuscitate, give **broad-spectrum antibiotics plus CLINDAMYCIN** (which switches off exotoxin production — see [[NEW_Drugs_05_Anti_infectives]] 0.2.12), and **call the surgical team immediately.** Every hour of delay costs tissue and life.
> - **Risk factors:** penetrating and contaminated trauma, crush injury, intravenous drug use, bowel and biliary surgery, malignancy (spontaneous *C. septicum* myonecrosis is associated with **occult colorectal cancer** — investigate the bowel afterwards), diabetes, and immunosuppression.
> - **Necrotising fasciitis is the differential and the management is the same: urgent surgical exploration.** Scoring tools do not exclude it. See [[11_01_Ortho_-_Orthopaedic_Emergencies]].

**Normal/abnormal:** Enterotoxin detected or not detected in stool; Gram-positive bacilli with tissue necrosis and characteristically **few inflammatory cells** on tissue Gram stain in myonecrosis.

**Alt:** Multiplex stool PCR panel (0.9) for the diarrhoeal syndrome; **surgical exploration — the definitive diagnostic and therapeutic step** in suspected myonecrosis; blood cultures; CT or plain radiographs for soft tissue gas; CK, lactate and a full septic screen.


## 0.24 Rubella / Varicella Serology (Rubella IgG, Varicella IgG)

> [!note] **Refiled here from `NEW_Investigations_Gastroenterology.md` §0.35 (Step 28, 2026-08-30)**, where the source build list had placed it. Content unchanged.

**D:** IgG serology establishing **immunity** (not acute infection) to rubella and varicella-zoster virus.

**Ind:** **Antenatal booking screening**; pre-conception counselling; healthcare worker immunity screening; before immunosuppression or transplant; after significant exposure in a pregnant or immunocompromised person.

**Role:** These are **immunity checks**. Acute infection is diagnosed by **IgM, PCR or clinical picture**, not by IgG.

> [!danger] **Do not ignore**
> **A non-immune pregnant woman exposed to varicella** — VZV immunoglobulin is time-critical and maternal varicella pneumonitis is dangerous; **the exposure-to-prophylaxis window is not stated here** (Australian guidance egress-blocked). **Rubella infection in the first trimester** causes congenital rubella syndrome. **Rubella and varicella vaccines are live and are contraindicated in pregnancy** — a non-immune woman is vaccinated **postpartum**, and this is the routine action that gets forgotten.

**Normal/abnormal:** IgG positive → immune. IgG negative → susceptible; vaccinate at the appropriate time and counsel about exposure.

**Alt:** PCR and IgM for acute infection; documented vaccination history (though serology is used where records are unavailable).
